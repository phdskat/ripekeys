SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DT;Review;
DE;"accumulation; autonomy; globalization; hegemony; soft geo-politics; nation-state";
ID;TRANSFORMATION;
AB;Many social scientists contend that the nation-state is experiencing a loss of power and autonomy in the era of economic globalization. In contrast, this article argues that as advanced capitalist nation-states actively promote economic globalization and its associated political institutions, they gain increased power and autonomy in this contemporary phase of their ongoing historical development. Economic globalization is theorized, first, as a 'soft' geo-politics, with which states use economic means to acquire international geo-political hegemony. More importantly, globalization represents a strategy with which advanced capitalist states - along with members of their capitalist classes - shift the politics of accumulation away from domestic citizenries to gain increased control over their political-economies and greater insulation from intra-national contestation. It is states' increased autonomy that provides them leverage to dissolve relationships of reciprocity, obligation, and shared determination that have embedded accumulation within the territorially rooted nation and that partly constitute the foundations of nation-hood and participatory citizenship. Individual states' ability to use globalization toward these ends depends upon their relative power within the inter-state system and their indigenous subaltern groups' capacity to retain partial control over economic decision-making, through collective action.;

DE;"historical transformation; modernity; capitalism; interstate system; historical materialism; political geography";
ID;"GLOBALIZATION; ABSOLUTISM; STATES";
AB;Starting from the premise that the proper foundation for the historicisation of international systems lies in the delineation of the prevailing social property relations of an epoch, my paper seeks to conceptualise the international relations of capitalist modernity. This endeavour, however, runs into problems when no conceptual basis in capitalist social relations can be spelled out that would specify clearly why capitalism needs an interstate system. Turning to history, I find that the emergence of territorial statehood in fact preceded the rise of capitalism. This then leads me to ask in what way the transition to capitalism in the 19th century transformed the content of international relations - but also, conversely, what the reproduction of the territorial form in this transition means for the development of capitalist societies. Finally, I will ask whether the current process of globalisation entails the restructuring of political space in line with the inherently global nature of capital. Has capitalism, in other words, 'worked its way through' to the international system and finally, after a 200-year long transitional period, subsumed 'the international' under its own global logic?;

DE;"exit; globalization; Hirschman; migration; sovereignty; voice";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; RESTRICTIONS; ECONOMY";
AB;In this article I introduce a framework for understanding the political effects of globalization on labor. While the globalization literature is rife with references to the effects of sovereignty from global trade and capital networks, there is surprisingly little written about the effects of increased labor mobility on national sovereignty. To fill this void, I adapt Albert Hirschman's (1970) model to examine how exit might affect national voice in the context of free international migration. This adapted framework generates concrete expectations about how increased mobility affects both internal and external conceptions of sovereignty. In particular, increased mobility is shown to improve the responsiveness of governments to citizen demands. Thus, in contrast to the general consensus that labor/voters benefit least from increased globalization, I suggest that the problem facing labor is not globalization, per se. In a world characterized by relatively free mobility for other factors of production (and their owners), labor/voters appear to be handicapped by being prisoners of territory.;

ID;"MODULAR PRODUCTION NETWORKS; FRESH VEGETABLES; COMMODITY CHAIN; TRADE; INDUSTRY; ORGANIZATION; FORMS";
AB;This article builds a theoretical framework to help explain governance patterns in global value chains. It draws on three streams of literature - transaction costs economics, production networks, and technological capability and firm-level learning - to identify three variables that play a large role in determining how global value chains are governed and change. These are: (1) the complexity of transactions, (2) the ability to codify transactions, and (3) the capabilities in the supply-base. The theory generates five types of global value chain governance - hierarchy, captive, relational, modular, and market - which range from high to low levels of explicit coordination and power asymmetry. The article highlights the dynamic and overlapping nature of global value chain governance through four brief industry case studies: bicycles, apparel, horticulture and electronics.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Turkey; globalization; alternative modernities; culture; crisis; production";
AB;This paper is an attempt to provide a political economic analysis of the changing nature of Turkish modernity since the 1980s, especially in the 1990s. Our analysis is founded upon the three years-long research (1999-2002) we have done on the question of 'the impacts of globalization on Turkey'. The Turkish economy has collapsed on 19 February 2001, and since then it has been going through a very strong and harsh restructuring programme aiming at creating a new mode of regulation of the state-society relations. The paper argues in this context that a political economic analysis of Turkish modernity is timely and necessary not only to understand the significant changes that have occurred in societal relations in terms of the emergence of new economic and civil society actors and their discourses / strategies, but also, and more importantly, to see that a long-term solution to the economic crisis requires taking seriously these actors and their societal visions. In doing so, the paper also attempts to contribute to the literature on global / alternative modernities by demonstrating how economy and culture are articulated in a specific national contenxt.;

It follows how the agenda is constructed and transformed throughout the period and gauges the extent to which pro-business networks are successful in the objectives pursued.;

DE;"Global Governance; hegemony; post-Fordist politics; crisis of neoliberal globalization; Foucaultian discourse concept; regulation theory";
AB;"Under the heading of 'Global Governance' a discussion is taking place on changes in political regulation at the international level. In this contribution Global Governance is understood as a discourse which is a part of the search process of emerging post-Fordist politics and its substantiation. This is based on the Foucault concept of discourse. It is analyzed in terms of five dimensions: 'globalisation'; 'world problems' and 'global challenges'; Realpolitik; 'Utopia' and democracy; and finally the 'general interest' of world society. This shows how Global Governance is articulated with the dominant transformations of the political which are understood from the perspective of regulation theory. It is demonstrated that this discourse, which legitimizes societal developments and provides a guide for action, is not at all in contradiction to the post-Fordist neoliberal transformation of society, but rather serves to make the handling of globalization-induced crises more effective. The article does not aim to provide a precise analysis of the discourse or its ontological and epistemological basis; instead it seeks to open up a perspective which should serve to stimulate discussion and research about the changing nature of international politics and hegemony.";

ID;"UNION; TRADE; GLOBALIZATION; POLICY";
AB;"This paper describes and explains the broad patterns of union internationalism championed by Europe and US labour unions. Descriptively, historical evidence reveals that cross-national organizing and cooperation among US and European unions vary most significantly on three dimensions: (1) despite being modest and taking a back-seat to national priorities, both US and European unions have meaningfully increased their cross-border ties since the 1970s; (2) these unions have prioritized intra-regional ties over developing-country or transatlantic coordination; and (3) US unions are more interested in labour rights policies and basic organizing, including somewhat more attention to developing-country and transatlantic initiatives, while their European counterparts focus on broader welfare policy and collective bargaining in their regional setting. Analytically, the argument is that such patch-work internationalism reflects not only patterns of economic 'globalization', but also historical-institutional features of domestic and international politics: Since transnationalism is difficult and costly for unions, unions invest scarce resources (organizers, money, political capital) on transnational activities to the degree that national opportunity structures limit policy, bargaining, and organizing benefits, and/or that one or another international setting promises significant new opportunities for achieving such benefits.";

AB;The International Monetary Fund claims that its loan conditions are apolitically devised because loans are negotiated by the technocratic staff and away from the possibly politicized Executive Board. Previous studies have suggested IMF Executive Board politicization but have not analyzed internal IMF documentation. Recently released IMF Article IV Consultations from the IMF Archives provide the opportunity for a new methodology based on searching for slippages in staff recommendations. It was found that two lenient IMF-Egyptian agreements had considerable slippages and two strict IMF-Egyptian agreements had little evidence of slippages. It was further found that the United States intervened in both the 1987 and 1991 agreements by usurping staff recommendations and undermining negotiations to ensure that these two agreements were lenient. The United States intervened in the 1987 and 1991 negotiations to preserve the political stability of the pro-Western Egyptian regime during a particularly turbulent time.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"industrialisation; SMEs; dualistic development; development policies; Chile; developing countries";
AB;This paper analyses the policy-making approach taken in Chile in the past three decades as a move away from unsatisfactory import substitution industrialisation (ISI), and as an affirmative response to the rule of free trade and globalisation. After many years of successful economic growth, Chile seems to be at a turning point. Indeed, the country's position in the new globalised market - like that of other small countries - appears weak compared to stronger competitors, such as China and other East Asian countries. This is rooted in the neoliberal policies that have been pursued for many years (although in a less orthodox way in the last decade) and that have had a significant impact on the economic structure of the country. The main effect of these policies has been a split between a small sector driven by modern, technologically advanced, large firms, and a larger sector of traditional, labour-intensive, micro and small enterprises. The divergence between the two sectors in terms of their economic characteristics and their relative performance prevents them from establishing any kind of linkages. Therefore, the capacity of the system to respond to international competition shrinks. The implicit practical adjustments in policy-making implemented by the main national development organisation(s) are not enough to surmount the present difficulties. A different kind of answer is needed, namely, industrial development strategies that are voluntarily and collectively organised, and that aim to reconnect the national production system, overcoming tendencies to fragmentation and making the country more competitive internationally.;

TI;Capitalism and ecological sustainability: the shaping of environmental policies;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"class and environmental struggles; value; regulation";
AB;Detailed analyses of environmental policies and their implications for the ecological sustainability of capitalism are missing from the eco-Marxist literature. Moreover, environmental policies have been often dismissed by several eco-Marxists on the ground that they are shaped on capital's terms. It is the objective of this paper to theorize the shaping of environmental regulation from a value-theoretic and class struggle perspective. It is argued that the negative economic impacts of pollution and resource depletion, captured by prices and rents, instigate various class and environmental conflicts and struggles which reshape the interchange between capitalism and nature. The state as a social site becomes an arena of these struggles. The state is called upon by the many different competing agents to mediate their access to nature. Evidence from many concrete cases shows that environmental policies and adjustments have been the outcome of this complex social interaction. However, the emerging ecological restructuring of capitalism can not guarantee its ecological sustainability.

AB;This article reviews and critically analyzes the research on the economic impact of the European Single Market Project. The empirical findings are contrasted with policymakers' plans for economic integration and with the theoretical models of integration and econometric simulations that have been at the forefront of scholarly debate over the last fifteen years. The knowledge about the impact of the Single Market project on trade and investments is based on relatively sound findings. However, in general, there is little evidence supporting the channels of impact suggested by economic integration theory. The widespread notion of a 'big bang' of liberalization is definitely inaccurate. Theoretical models and empirical simulations projected a process the impact of which would be broad, deep, and dynamic, but as the EU Commission concluded, 'real life is rarely so simple'. There is no convincing empirical evidence of European integration having led to either short-term or sustained economic growth effects. The regulatory changes of the Single Market project were part of a global process of economic restructuring and mainly served to enhance the competitiveness of world-market oriented European companies.;

DT;Article;
DE;"barter; financial crisis; capitalism; neoliberalism; Washington Consensus; Russia";
ID;CAPITALISM;
AB;A phenomenal spread of unconventional means of payments has been one of the most controversial features of Russia's post-socialist economic development. Orthodox analyses tend to trace the causes of the non-monetary economy to the inconsistency of political reforms, to the legacy of the past, and to endemic corruption. This article challenges such accounts. From the perspective of international political economy, the proliferation of non-payments, severe liquidity squeeze and the structural disjuncture between Russia's financial and productive circuits are the outcomes of the country's pursuit of the paradigm of the Washington Consensus. In this light, barter and non-payments in Russia are neither the 'inevitable' features of the market restructuring, nor simply the residue of the command system. The non-monetary economy in Russia is a peculiar reaction to the politico-economic imperatives brought onto the country by the deregulated financial markets and by the neoliberal political ideology that underpins their global expansion.;

DT;Article;
DE;"imperialism; neoliberalism; external debt";
AB;"At the turn of the 21st century, US imperialism appears very strong. The paper focuses on economic mechanisms. Both direct investment abroad and portfolio investment contribute extensively to the remuneration of capital in the United States, under the form of interest, dividends and profits of transnational corporations retained abroad. The rates of return on these investments are high, in particular when compared to the returns of foreigners when they invest in the United States. The major contradiction results from the growing external trade imbalance. The outflow of dollars to the rest of the world is invested back in the country by foreigners. Their stock of assets on the United States is now the double of the stock of assets of this country on the rest of the world; the flow of income paid to foreigners is equal to that received from the rest of the world. These deficits are due to the tremendous wave of consumption by the richest fraction of the population, which followed the restoration of the income and wealth of these classes in neoliberalism. This path is unsustainable in the long run. A new phase is, therefore, on the agenda: a new configuration of neoliberalism or beyond neoliberalism?";

DE;"corporate governance; elites; financialisation; neoliberalism; present day capitalism";
ID;"COMPENSATION; PERFORMANCE; FIRM; MARKET; PAY";
AB;"This paper raises fundamental questions about the political and economic conditions and consequences of UK and US corporate governance. It does so by locating corporate governance in present day capitalism. Politically, the rise of governance since the early 1990s is part of a more general discursive attempt to combine neoliberalism with social responsibility, which works in the specific case of corporate governance by constructing a plausible but intellectually fragile narrative about agency problems and solutions which would align shareholder and management interests. Economically, the initial promise of corporate governance in the 1990s and the growing disappointment with governance in the early 2000s are then related to successive phases of financialisation: governance promised much in the 1990s as long as the bull market delivered equity value for shareholders; while the limits of corporate governance were demonstrated after the tipping point in the different circumstances of the early 2000s. It is then argued that disappointment is inevitable because procedural rules cannot control the self-serving behaviour of social and political elites in the UK and US. If corporate governance was ostensibly about safeguarding shareholder interests, effectively corporate governance sanctioned a huge increase in absolute and relative pay for US and UK top managers who remain the major beneficiaries of governance in a world where the giant corporation has become an important accelerator of inequality.";

DE;"asymmetrical regulation; new constitutionalism; private-public partnerships; new populism; open method of co-ordination; European governance";
AB;This paper argues that economic and monetary regulation at the supranational level and social deregulation at the national level are two sides of the same coin. Contrary to mainstream multilevel governance literature, it tries to answer why this mode of asymmetrical governance has emerged and what kind of European Union it seeks to promote. Under the heading of competitiveness, economic and monetary decision-making power moves beyond nation-states and democratic accountability, in the process disembedding the European welfare systems and pushing the so-called European model of welfare capitalism towards the 'shareholder practices' of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. In the meantime, illusions of national sovereignty and a People's Europe are upheld. Here enters the New Populism: by introducing vagaries such as 'subsidiarity' and 'flexibility' into the European Treaties, and by using terms from consultancy like 'best practice' and 'benchmarking', the illusion of national self-determination is maintained while creepingly empowering a European 'invisible hand'.;

ID;"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; BIOTECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; LAW";
AB;This paper examines the interrelationships between the two regimes of sovereignty and property rights over bioresources in the light of two international agreements, namely the CBD and TRIPS. It considers the underlying problem pertaining to the regulation of access to biological resources as a problem which is related to prevailing capitalist relations rather than to the strengthening or undermining of state sovereignty. Thus, it addresses two inter-related issues: the divergence between and intersection of these two regimes, and the question of whether the institutional movement from sovereignty rights to private property rights points to the erosion of biodiversity protection due to the undermining of states' rights over biological resources in favour of corporate interests. An investigation of these issues suggests that the CBD and the TRIPS agreement are part of the same set of politico-economic relations despite their differences in normative and institutional terms, and that the sovereign rights of states and the intellectual property rights of corporations over biological resources are complementary rather than contradictory given the exploitation of the environment in the process of capital accumulation on a global scale.;

AB;Under George W. Bush, the United States has chosen to revolutionize world affairs by abandoning successful forms of hegemonic governance, based on the institutionalization of collective economic and security regimes, in favor of militarism, or the pursuit of global domination through force. Starting from a critique of structuralist approaches, this paper examines the ideational transformation of the American right and situates it within the context of the US's emergence in 1991 as a unipolar strategic actor and as the core state in the newly globalized capitalist political economy. While these synchronous transformations considerably augmented America's autonomy, giving the US the opportunity to reconfigure the world system to its advantage, one must distinguish between the current imperial expansionism of the revived and expanded US national security state and earlier forms of US hegemonic rule. The aim: to account for a fundamental shift of the way in which the US has governed the capitalist world system since 1945.;

ID;"GLOBALIZATION; TAXATION; ECONOMIES; DYNAMICS; POLITICS; HAVENS; PLACE; MONEY";
AB;"International cooperation could help governments regulate mobile transnational corporations (TNCs), but cooperation is itself embedded in transnational political processes in which TNCs and other private actors exercise influence. This study of the OECD's project on ""Harmful Tax Competition"" argues that international cooperation has done little to enhance governments' capacities to tax TNCs, and that normative deliberations in which private actors played central roles were crucial to this outcome. State-centric, functionalist models of international cooperation therefore need to be supplemented with insights from social constructivism and with greater attention to non-state actors. In the process of defining a boundary between legitimate and illegitimate forms of tax competition, liberal economic norms encouraged a narrow focus on tax preferences rather than corporate tax rates, and materially weak tax havens were able to use normative arguments to persuade the OECD to moderate its demands, in part because they found a sympathetic audience among TNCs and the transnational tax service industry. These transnational actors also persuaded the OECD to acknowledge the legitimacy of international tax planning and legal tax avoidance. The scope of the HTC project further narrowed after 2001 because of Bush administration's anti-tax ideology, and now focuses only on improving the exchange of information among tax authorities. This resolution of the issue is unstable because of normative inconsistencies and continuing threats to corporate tax revenues.";

AB;Against the background of contemporary debates on globalization and the crystallization of a post-Westphalian world order, this article develops an interpretation of state spatial restructuring in post-1970s western Europe. While many analyses of globalization and the changing state have focused on the construction of new supranational political regimes, such as the European Union, it is argued here that subnational scales, particularly those of major urban regions, represent strategic institutional arenas in which far-reaching transformations of state spatiality are unfolding. I suggest, in particular, that processes of urban governance represent a key mechanism for the rescaling of state space. First, managerial-welfarist forms of urban governance are shown to have played a major role in the consolidation and eventual crisis of Keynesian welfare national states between the 1950s and the mid-1970s. Second, the entrepreneurial approaches to urban governance that have proliferated during the post-1970s period are interpreted as significant expressions and catalysts of 'glocalization strategies' oriented towards a fundamental rescaling of national state space. In contrast to the project of national territorial equalization associated with Keynesian welfare national states, glocalization strategies promote the formation of Glocalizing Competition State Regimes (GCSRs) in which (a) significant aspects of economic regulation are devolved to subnational institutional levels and (b) major socioeconomic assets are reconcentrated within the most globally competitive urban regions and industrial districts. Urban governance therefore represents an essential institutional scaffolding upon which the national and subnational geographies of state regulation are configured as well as one of the major politico-institutional mechanisms through which those geographies are currently being reworked. The article concludes by underscoring the ways in which GCSRs exacerbate intra-national uneven spatial development, leading in turn to the introduction of new crisis-management strategies that further differentiate the institutional and scalar landscapes of state regulation.;

Moreover, this is a discourse that focuses relatively too much upon (a) the characteristics of global/world cities and (b) the processes creating global/world cities versus (b) and (c) governance issues and implications. Consequently there remain many unanswered questions about how global cities have 'come into being', and what is the role of the state in intentionally devising pathways to global city formation. In such a conceptual context, we tease out the main contours of three forms of global cities - hyper global cities; emerging global cities; and global city-states - in emphasizing the need to consider differential and dynamic developmental pathways. Drawing upon the case of Singapore, we then analyse the unique nature of the global city-state, especially in a Pacific Asian context associated with strategic 'plan rational' developmental states. The conjunction of a Pacific Asian city-state with developmentalist policies and capacities both requires and enables this form of global city to be rapidly and constantly reworked in the aim of embedding the city into an extraterritorial terrain of network relations.";

AB;Habermas's rules-based deliberative democratic perspective underscores issues of power, legitimacy and justice. The article deploys this perspective to reveal how the lack of legitimating procedures and rational deliberation at the World Trade Organization (WTO) yields power politics and unjust outcomes. It examines the rule-making process in the successive trade Rounds that led up to the WTO, as well as the politics of the organisation's rule-application and consensus-making practices.;

ID;"LEGALIZATION; GATT/WTO; POWER; LAW";
AB;"The dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a controversial exercise in legalization at the international level, with direct implications for inequality between developed and developing countries. Conventional wisdom suggests that moves to establish binding, third-party arbitration in international law generally favor smaller, less powerful states. Nevertheless, many of the most pointed criticisms of the new WTO system and the most radical reform proposals have come from developing countries, its presumed beneficiaries. To unravel this paradox, I examine the role of the Appellate Body, which has become the principal engine of institutional change in the WTO system. Like all quasi-judicial actors, the Appellate Body has a certain level of delegated authority, especially over procedural issues. Despite objections from WTO members, the Appellate Body has brought about several significant procedural reforms. It has broadened the access of third parties in appellate proceedings; opened the door to amicus curiae submissions by private individuals and organizations; and endorsed the representation of governments by private counsel. In all three moves, the Appellate Body - whose legitimacy remains contested - generates information about the political context and potential consequences of its rulings. Its institutional interests, however, at times conflict with those of developing countries in the WTO, as these decisions on balance threaten to exacerbate existing inequalities, at least in the short term.";

DE;"WTO; trade policy; negotiations; international organization; transparency; developing countries";
AB;When we ask where the WTO is going after its debacle in Seattle its success in Doha, and the failure in Cancun, we find neither imminent collapse nor a new grand design. My analysis of the difference between these ministerial meetings separates the inter-linked themes of inadequate WTO procedure, the evolving trade policy agenda, and the changing role of developing countries. The first frame is the effort to make the institution stronger by improving internal and external transparency. The second frame is about the demands to deepen WTO disciplines in the era of globalization, when the meaning of liberalization moves from border measures to domestic regulations. The third frame is about making the WTO wider, where the context includes debates on the meaning of 'development'. After exploring these frames, and their implications for where the WTO is going, I speculate on what the Single Undertaking of the Doha round might contain. I use a metaphor to simplify a complex story about the difference between bargaining in incremental time and negotiating in conjunctural time: the WTO is 'crossing the river by feeling the stones'.;

DE;"World Trade Organisation; new trade agenda; Doha development agenda; international political economy; transnational mercantilism";
ID;"HUMAN-RIGHTS; WTO; ORGANIZATION; STANDARDS; POLITICS; SEATTLE; REGIME; AGENDA; LAW";
AB;It is often argued that the problems currently facing the World Trade Organization stem from an important shift in the trade agenda from tariff reduction to the harmonisation of domestic regulations considered as non tariff barriers. From this perspective, the lack of harmonisation of domestic regulations severely impairs the capacity of the WTO to fulfil its mission. This article argues, in contrast, that the underlying problems facing the contemporary trade agenda are different, and are caused by a lack of differentiation in the regulatory framework of the WTO. To substantiate this claim, a conception of transnational mercantilism is derived from recent scholarly revisions of classical mercantilism. This clarifies a continuity between the external dimension and the comprehensive pattern of social organisation involved in the political economy of international trade. This framework is used to appraise four structures upon which trade policy is predicated: the implementation of market mechanisms, the embeddedness of trade in state-society relations, the link between trade and the natural environment, and special and differential treatment for developing countries.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"China; Agenda 21; environmental regulation; environmental policy; energy; sustainable development";
AB;Agenda 21 is the voluminous policy document that emanated from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Using a brief case study of China's energy use - specifically its use of coal - this article illustrates the degree to which objectives of Agenda 21 are reflected in China's economic development policies and practices. China has started to shift its economic development toward a more environmentally sustainable trajectory, as reflected in its changing policies on energy derived from coal burning. We conclude that while China's environmental policies have been stimulated in part by Agenda 21 and other international environmental undertakings, such 'soft' international agreements are far from the only important determinants and variables. Many factors, such a bureaucratic infighting, disagreements between central and provincial governments, as well as corruption, severely delimit the extent and efficacy of energy policies and other environmental regulations. Because economic growth remains central to development goals, existing environmental policies are only a start toward environmentally sustainable development. Environmental decline still outpaces sustainable development in China, and this will continue for many years to come.;

AB;"Globalization is widely held to circumscribe the parameters of political and economic choice in contemporary Europe, just as it has come to circumscribe the parameters of debate on the future of European models of capitalism. Yet opinions on the question of convergence nonetheless vary markedly, with proponents of the hyperglobalization thesis pointing to a simple and inexorable process of neoliberal convergence while an increasingly influential school of neo-institutionalists point to a rather more complex process of 'dual' or 'co-convergence', reinforcing the distinctiveness of liberal and coordinated market economies. In both accounts, the exhibited pattern of convergence (dual or otherwise) is seen to be driven by globalization. In this paper I provide a theoretical and empirical critique of this important literature, challenging the contextualization of the question of convergence with respect to globalization which both perspectives share. I advance a distinctive variant of the new institutionalism which emphasizes: (i) the contingency of any process of convergence observed; (ii) the frequently political as opposed to economic nature of convergent tendencies; (iii) the countertendencies which might be mobilized to such tendencies; and (iv) the invariably far greater significance, in the establishment of common trajectories, of regional rather than genuinely global processes of integration. Though common trajectories are discernible within contemporary Europe, associated in particular with the institutional architecture of EMU and an accelerating process of European economic integration, they have been embraced more or less enthusiastically and at variable paces, leading not to convergent but to divergent outcomes.";

ID;"KNOWLEDGE; BUSINESS; ECONOMY; CULTURE; PLACE; MONEY";
AB;This paper attempts to develop a conceptual framework for analysing the impacts of the Internet and e-commerce upon industrial sectors. While a great deal has been written about the so-called 'new economy' much of it has been either speculative and hyperbolic, as in the 'boom' years of the late 1990s, or cynical and dismissive, as in the period since the collapse of 'dot.com' stocks in Spring 2000. We seek to move beyond and between these positions by providing a means to determine what difference the Internet and e-commerce might make to industrial organization through a consideration of the retail financial services industry. We do this through a critical evaluation of the concept of disintermediation that, as we argue in the paper, is better understood as reintermediation. We argue that the potential impacts of the Internet and e-commerce upon retail financial services are non-trivial, and they are consistent with the individualization of risk and reward that have characterized wider processes of financial inclusion and exclusion over the past decade or so.;

AB;Much of the academic finance literature has been devoted to theoretical principles concerning portfolio design, the efficient market and strategic asset allocation. Similarly, industry organization studies have been concerned with the fundamentals of firm structure, entry and exit from the industry, and spatial and industrial concentration. But finance is also a never-ending series of daily stories, issuing from the pink pages of respectable broadsheet newspapers and other print media and increasingly dominated by the cacophony of voices, images and events broadcast by television and on-line real-time data services. Finance has become a media event, with its breathless reporters and star anchorpersons more often approximating Entertainment Tonight or even (at the limit) MTV. This fact of financial life could be treated as ephemeral and of minor significance (compared to the 'real' facts of economic principles). But financial institutions take it very seriously indeed. How and why this is the case are the topics of this paper. Drawing upon recent studies of the industry and media, as well as our own studies of the industry and its decision-making protocols, we sketch the elements of finance as entertainment. We emphasize the format and content of morning shows such as those broadcast on CNBC as well as the implications of programmes like these for the trading strategies of major financial conglomerates. The paper closes with comments on the implied research agenda.;

AB;This article considers current explanations of the link between globalization and democratization in light of an empirical case study: that of a 1998-99 campaign led by Egyptian NGOs against government restrictions on the freedom of association. The article calls attention to the need to 'bring politics back in' to theories of the link between globalization and democratization, by studying the political strategies of actors, the longer-term local, historical context against which these strategies are formed and their impact upon existing relations of power. The first part of this article reviews some of the major arguments regarding the link between globalization and democratization in order to highlight their focus on structural changes in explaining democratization. The second part proposes an alternative explanatory framework, based on the Gramscian concepts of hegemony and counter-hegemony. The third and fourth parts operationalize this framework through presenting the context for the actions of NGOs in Egypt and the case study of NGO efforts for greater democratization. Finally, the conclusion brings together the conceptual and empirical discussions.;

ID;"FINANCE; SYSTEM; WORLD";
AB;Since the mid-1970s sales, finance and production (i.e. all three circuits of capital), as well as the concentration and centralization of capital, have been internationalized to an extent that has never been seen before in history. This unprecedented economic globalization has been accompanied by the strengthening of international organizations and regulation to facilitate the internationalization of trade, finance and production, but serious attempts to globalize social rights, the provision of public goods, democracy, and environmental norms have been weak or hardly existent.;
;The so-called 'anti-globalization movement' challenges the negative consequences of this one-dimensional internationalization, and as it has gained strength policyrnakers and academics from various disciplines have increasingly come to discuss trajectories and possible alternatives for the future development of the international system. This paper takes up the incipient debates about cosmopolitanism and argues that any project towards a more just and democratic world order will necessarily have to turn the current one-dimensional internationalization of regulation and governance upside down.;

TI;The 'new economy' and social risk: banking on the poor?;

DE;"microcredit; microfinance; finance; poverty; development; World Bank";
AB;The rise of the 'new economy' in many of the advanced capitalist states since the 1970s has entailed a re-organization of global social and political relations generally. These changes become apparent in analyses that focus on trends and shifts in the global political economy. In the context of these adjustments, discourses of 'poverty reduction' have come to prominence, with a particular financially steered strategy emerging as a key approach to 'poverty reduction' on a global scale, namely microcredit. I argue that the microcredit approach to poverty reduction is strategically embedded in the global political economy. It has been appropriated primarily to facilitate the implementation of financial sector liberalization on a global scale. Additionally, the contexts in which these programmes are implemented also reflect the motive of achieving a form of social disciplining aimed at commanding compliance for neo-liberal restructuring more generally. I develop this argument through an analysis of the way in which microcredit is located in - and implemented through - the institutional policy framework of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the consequent implications this has for the realization of the wider objectives of these institutions in global politics. The argument elucidates the relationship between efforts to advance the imperatives of the 'new economy', the microcredit approach to poverty reduction, and the (re)-production of social risk.;

DE;"poverty reduction; social inclusion; liberalism; third way; developing countries; New Zealand";
ID;"NEOLIBERALISM; STRATEGY";
AB;In the wake of frank neo-liberalism, and in the context of rising security fears, ways are being found to provide market liberalism with a more inclusive face. The Poverty Reduction Strategies currently prominent in international development, and Thirdway OECD 'Social Inclusion' policy frames claim common purpose to promote 'opportunity, empowerment and security' for people and places on the peripheries of global economies and societies. They share commitments to global economic integration and openness, market led growth, 'good' and 'joined up' governance, local and social partnerships, and wide-ranging activation of 'capacities'. But the high rhetorical aspirations of liberalism to social 'inclusivity' have so far overreached empirical gains for the poor. Drawing on developing country examples of Poverty Reduction Strategy and public policy in New Zealand's current Labour government, this paper sketches salient features of 'inclusive' liberalism. It critically examines its status as a Polanyian turn within a wider liberal project, which seeks to re-embed and legitimate a liberal social and economic order.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"postmarxism; systems theory; autopoiesis; the political; globalization";
AB;This paper is concerned with a reactivation of the dimension of the political in political economy. The question of politicization is explored in connection with recent theoretical reflection on postmarxism and the systems theory of Luhmann. A main contention is that, in contrast to naturalistic perspectives, there is no pre-given object of political economy. Rather the objectivation of the economy has to be considered in strictly hegemonic terms, terms that, I argue, are the condition of possibility for a politicization of political economy. On these grounds, the paper advances an alternative approach to political economy that may be considered radical insofar as it does not attempt to conceal the fundamental dimension of the political. This approach will be developed further in the context of contemporary themes and debates surrounding the question of globalization and the potential openings for hegemonic intervention by the left. Here again the status of the political is taken to be paramount.;

ID;"MUSIC INDUSTRY; ORGANIZATION; CREATIVITY; NETWORKS";
AB;Production and distribution activities in Hollywood are secured by two main types of firms, majors and independents, complemented by a third type represented by majors' subsidiaries. The characteristics of these firms are detailed, first, in terms of their functions within the Hollywood production agglomeration itself, and second, in terms of their roles in external distribution and marketing. The structure of domestic motion-picture markets is described, with special reference to the geography of exhibition. A statistical analysis of film releasing activity is presented. It is argued that the industry is segmented into three overlapping market tiers, and a hypothetical model of this phenomenon is proposed. Export markets for Hollywood films are shown to have expanded greatly in recent years, partly as a result of strategic trade initiatives underwritten by the US government. The paper ends with a brief commentary on the cultural predicaments raised by the globalization of Hollywood and on the sources of possible future competitive threats to its hegemony.;

ID;"GROWTH; INSTITUTIONS; INCENTIVES; REGIMES; FREEDOM";
AB;"Prior to Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China, some political economists predicted that a regime shift from London to Beijing would result in a deterioration of Hong Kong's economic and institutional freedoms. Such predictions would seem to have proven accurate according to annual indices of international economic freedom and competitiveness. These have seen Hong Kong's previously high ranking decline. However, whether Chinese sovereignty or local Hong Kong government ineptitude is responsible for such decline is uncertain; both have been blamed for a series of incidents that have brought Hong Kong's competitiveness and economic, civil and political freedoms into question. Using data collected from 130 domestic and foreign firms in Hong Kong, this paper disentangles the degree to which the 'high politics' of the city now being part of China or the 'low politics' of local government action account for Hong Kong's diminished international reputation for economic freedom and competitiveness. Results for all firms suggest that both Chinese sovereignty and local government actions are equally to blame, but that Chinese sovereignty mediates adverse local government actions. However, results differ by firm origin, and those for domestic Hong Kong firms cast doubt on the general success of China's 'one country, two systems' policy and raise specific concerns about the policy's potential applicability to Taiwan. Overall, results highlight the importance of macro-political economy factors in assessing comparative international competitiveness and provide objective evidence in support of international political economy theory suggesting that a shift from liberal to more authoritarian regimes will adversely affect already affluent economies.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Thylorism; entrepreneurship; drug trade; immigration; organized crime; globalization";
AB;Scholars have long posited that an ethnic division of labour influences the opportunity structures faced by immigrants, relegating them to the margins in the formal, informal and criminal economies. Opportunity structures, however, are embedded in broader economic contexts and, as argued by the globalization literature these contexts appear to be undergoing a striking change. This articles explores the extent to which dynamics of economic globalization have altered the ethnic division of labour in the core sector of the criminal economy-the illicit drug trade. A plausibility probe of patterns of immigrant participation in the illicit drug sector in Japan, Germany and the US reveals that rather than altering the nature of ethnic divisions of labour in the criminal economy, globalization appears to be reinforcing existing patterns of selective marginalization and empowerment.;

AB;This article proposes that the post-communist transition in Poland can profitaby be understood through the concept of the transnationalization of the state. It argues that change in Eastern and Central Europe has predominately been explained as a domestic process with few attempts made to contextualize the changes taking place in the region as part of neoliberal globalization. Therefore it explores the restructuring of the Polish state since 1989 by connecting concrete instances of policy to broader historical processes, social structures and political economy through the process of the transnationalization of the state. Rather than a loss of power or withdrawal of the state, setting transition as part of a wider transnationalization process reveals the subtleties of the restructuring of state apparatuses and hierarchies in the relationship between state and capital. The article reflects this by investigating the role adopted by the Polish state in representing the interests of a nascent bourgeoisie as they are increasingly penetrated by transnational capital and the impact of administration through the transnationalization of the state.;

AB;This paper examines recent policy discussions on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and their central role in the democratization of civil society. The author argues that the policy debate on NGOs exemplifies the conflict between liberalism and socialism, or more specifically between private interest and public good. The contemporary context of neoliberal economic policies and structural adjustment represents a vindication of liberal norms, and the ascendancy of NGOs is theorized in this context. An analysis of recent policy positions on NGOs and their role in promoting governance and development is illustrative of the complex ways in which NGOs, at local and international levels, are being incorporated into the neoliberal model of civil society.;

AB;"International relations theorists attribute the post-1930 collapse of the world economy into protectionism and rival trading blocs to global causes such as hegemonic decline, problems of collective action and free riding, or the macroeconomic disturbance of the Great Depression. This article links protectionism and the formation of trading blocs to political pressure from manufacturing firms unable to take advantage of economies of scale due to the limited size of national markets. A comparative analysis of trade policy in this period demonstrates that small-scale producers with small domestic markets in Japan, the UK and Germany vigorously advocated the formation of protectionist trading blocs. However, large-scale firms in the US, with a vast continental market at their disposal, sought trade liberalization; instead of seeking a trading bloc of their own, these firms also pushed to eliminate commercial discrimination in foreign empires. The analysis concludes that while technological changes requiring access to larger than national markets help to explain political pressure for trading blocs today, the incentives for trade protection are weaker in contemporary regional arrangements.";

AB;This editorial introduction to the tenth anniversary issue of the Review of International Political Economy places both the birth of RIPE the journal and the critiques that it has spawned of the so-called 'Washington consensus' in a longer historical context. We map the emergence of two distinct 'Washington Consensi' - one based around GATT/Bretton Woods/Welfare States/and Kenynesian ideas and one based around the WTO/Open Capital Accounts/Hard Currencies and New-Classical Ideas. We argue that RIPE appeared at the moment when this second of these consensi appeared most hegemonic. RIPE's distinct voice over the last decade reflects this through its critiques of the second Washington consensus and in its pluralistic and critical mode of inquiry. We place the essays that follow into this wider discussion of broad trends in the IPE.;

AB;The world is currently experiencing a surge of international regulations aimed at limiting the development policy options of developing country governments. Of the three big agreements coming out of the Uruguay Round - on investment measures (TRIMS), trade in services (GATS), and intellectual property rights (TRIPS) - the first two limit the authority of developing country governments to constrain the choices of companies operating in their territory, while the third requires the governments to enforce rigorous property rights of foreign (generally Western) firms. Together the agreements make comprehensively illegal many of the industrial policy instruments used in the successful East Asian developers to nurture their own industrial and technological capacities and are likely to lock in the position of Western countries at the top of the world hierarchy of wealth. The paper describes how the three agreements constitute a modern version of Friedrich List's 'kicking away the ladder'. It then outlines some needed changes in the way we think about development and in the role of multilateral organizations. It concludes that the practical prospects for change along these lines are slender, but not negligible.;

ID;"CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE; ECONOMY; INFLATION; WORLD";
AB;The management of money is always and everywhere political: for every policy choice, there is an alternative that some actors would prefer. The contemporary salience of enormous and influential financial markets has obscured this immutable political reality, by leaving the impression that market forces transcend politics, and render political conflicts moot. Since market forces impose the 'best practice' on states, policies are chosen by the force of economic logic rather than by politics and the winners and losers must fall where they may. But this is an illusion, albeit a powerful illusion, a consequence of the distinct and crucial role that ideas and beliefs play in the monetary arena: what people think about money, right or wrong, can create self-fulfilling prophecies. In fact, economic theory is indeterminate in its ability to account for most monetary policy choices. Even in a world of globalized finance, the difference between many plausible policies is of ambiguous, or, at most, modest economic effect. Economic logic does limit the range of policy choices to a plausible set. But the choice from that set is inevitably determined by the inescapable politics of money.;

DE;"globalization; IPE; discourse";
AB;Debates about globalization are now central to the enterprise of IPE. The substantive research agenda of globalization studies has yielded a number of strategies to qualify or refute commonplace claims about globalization found in much policy discourse. Yet the achievements of such scholarship have not induced discernible shifts in the deployment of 'globalization' as a key shaper of the realities of contemporary political economy. At an analytical level globalization studies in IPE suffer from a number of ambiguities that relate to definition, measurement and the nature of 'globalization' as a variable in explanation. Orthodox (rationalist) reasoning might seek to either abandon or 'normalize' the concept of 'globalization'. In contrast, this article calls for the 'ideational' matter of globalization to be taken more seriously and for studies of globalization discourse to occupy a more central position in the project of IPE.;

ID;POLITICAL-ECONOMY;
AB;Recent scholarship on globalization has conflated methodological critiques of rationalism with ontological arguments. American rationalist paradigms of IPE, it is argued, are too state-centred and utilitarian to offer convincing explanations for emerging non-state forms of global governance. In response, this essay argues that rationalist theories do provide important theoretical tools to understand the political economy of globalization, even in its hierarchical forms. An examination of the changing forms of contractual relations between international organizations and non-governmental organizations, the functions of international credit rating agencies, and the growth of offshore tax havens, shows that underlying utilitarian incentives for political behaviour can be uncovered and explicated, even within these non-state forms of contemporary global governance. Consequently, the appropriateness of any given IPE method should depend upon the research question asked, not pre-existing assumptions about the inherent advantages of either rationalist or non-rationalist approaches.;

AB;If neoliberal ideology was quite globally dominant at the time of RIPE's creation, it is much less so ten years later. But what is replacing the 'Washington consensus'? This question is difficult to answer in part because the critiques of neoliberalism have come from such varied ideological sources. Some opponents of neoliberalism draw inspiration from the three ideologies which presented the most prominent critiques of nineteenth-century classical economic liberalism: economic nationalism, Marxism and embedded liberalism. But history is not simply repeating itself. These 'old' critiques of economic liberalism have been reworked and updated in various ways to meet the neoliberal challenge. Equally important, other oppositional movements today present 'newer' critiques of economic liberalism, most notably those inspired by feminist thought, green ideology, and 'civilizational' perspectives on political economy.;

AB;The last quarter century has seen a broad and quite appropriate belief in the efficacy of market organization developed into a dogmatic belief in the market as the best way to govern virtually all economic activities. This undiscriminating belief severely hinders the efforts of societies to find a suitable governance mode for the wide variety of activities for which simple market organization is not appropriate. This essay is concerned with laying out the complexities of market organization that often are needed to make it work well, and the range of activities where market organization does not work well as a basic governing mode.;

DT;Article;
DE;"dollarization; currency bloc; monetary union; monetary relations; US foreign policy; Latin America; regionalism";
AB;Beginning in 1999, US policymakers suddenly began to debate the idea of encouraging Latin American countries to adopt the US dollar as their domestic currency. In this article, I show that the US debate concerning the pros and cons of 'dollarization diplomacy' has two interesting historical precedents that help us understand the politics of US policymaking in this area. The first took place between 1900 and 1915 when the US also showed considerable interest in the idea of promoting the use of dollar within many Latin American countries. Then, in the 1940s and 1950s, US policymakers did an about-face and encouraged those same countries to 'de-dollarize'. To date, these dramatic changes in this aspect of US-Latin American monetary relations in the twentieth century have received very little scholarly attention. But I argue that a study of them is useful in identifying what influences US foreign economic policy towards dollarization abroad today. I show how US policy, both in the past and present, has been influenced by: prevalent macroeconomic ideologies, domestic economic interests, and geopolitical concerns.;

DE;"East Asia; regional integration; monetary regionalism; bilateral trade";
ID;"EAST-ASIA; CRISIS; PACIFIC; JAPAN; APEC";
AB;The financial crises of the late 1990s marked an intellectual watershed for the global economy, and also for regionalism as the Janus face of globalization. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the theory and practice of regional cooperation and integration may evolve along different lines to how it was understood for most of the second half of the twentieth century. In East Asia, in particular, this will mean that the relationship between multilateralism and regionalism will change. The 'East Asian' region will become an increasingly important domain within which to explore enhanced protection against financial crises. What we might call 'monetary regionalism', sceptical western voices notwithstanding, is now firmly on the regional agenda in East Asia.;
;Within conventional political economy, the theory and practice of monetary regionalism is not as easy to understand as traditional, trade-driven, regional integration. Thus one aim of this paper is to outline a theory of monetary regionalism and demonstrate the degree to which it represents a break with understandings of the regional project in East Asia prior to the late 1990s. From its start in 1989, APEC claimed to be a new type of regionalism. The promise was that APEC would promote open regionalism. APEC did not achieve this goal. Nor did it provide support to its Asian members during the financial crises of the late 1990s.;
;At the same time, more traditional (what we might call Balassian) understandings of trade-driven regional integration are showing signs of decreasing importance. There is a growing appeal to trade co-operation, but this is notably an increasing interest in bilateral preferential trading arrangements. This leads to a complex picture of competing regional initiatives across the economic policy spectrum. The paper locates these initiatives in the wider context of the growing politico-economic dialogue between Southeast and Northeast Asia that has developed via the ASEAN+3 process since 1997.;

AB;This paper explores institutionalism and New Labour as overlapping and intersecting responses to neoliberalism and the New Right. It links institutionalism to the Labour Party and its advocacy of networks and joined-up governance in much the same way as we have come to tie neoliberalism to the New Right and its faith in the new public management. Because the paper's interpretive approach modifies institutionalism, the link it draws between New Labour and institutionalism also points to something of a critique of these latter. At times, they seek to tame the contingency of social life by reducing the complex to theories about the allegedly given characteristics of institutional forms.;

AB;"This paper examines the degree to which a new global mode of regulation (MOR) or social structure of accumulation (SSA) has emerged which may help to promote long wave upswing in the world economy. A series of institutional proxies are employed in this paper. Attention is given to the system-functions of global productivity and demand, through the performance of the prevailing system of production-distribution (SPD); global financial stability, proxied by the operations of the IMF; and global conflict resolution over trade issues, proxied through the workings of the WTO. The main findings are threefold. First, the SPD is only partially developed so as to promote productivity and demand. Second, some significant financial stability functions have been instigated through the IMF. And third, the WTO is undergoing major conflict due to the opposing policy proposals and criticisms by non-government organizations. This supports the conclusion that only limited success has been made in the emergence of a global MOR or SSA, not yet enough to promote (sustained) long wave upswing. The emergence of an effective global MOR or SSA to propel long wave upswing in the global economy is thus in the early-to-medium phase of development. Periodic uncertainty and deep recession (of an uneven character, interspersed with short-cycle upswings), are thus expected in the dominant economies during the early years of the twenty-first century until suitable institutional innovations emerge.";

Technology is a form of knowledge like others that have been recognized as important in the creation of international institutions. However technology has three additional distinctive features which are especially important in structuring actors' conduct: material embeddedness; complex path dependence; and technical authority. I specify a set of propositions which state that in international institutions in issue areas with technical systems their creation, content of norms, structure, development and sources of political conflict are all shaped by the technical system with which these institutions interact.

AB;The succesful conclusion of the 1997 WTO agreements on trade in basic telemcommunication and financial services surprised many observers. During the negotiations, US officials took a hard line in demanding improved offers (including on sensitive issues such as foreign ownership and domestic deregulation) and threatened discriminatory treatment against countries they believed were free-riding. But because most of the targeted states lacked firms that could benefit from access to the US market, and because the talks focussed only on individual sectors, it was uncertain that this strategy would have the desired effect. Traditional approaches to understanding bargaining outcomes provide only partial explanations for the results of US pressure during these negotiations. This article argues that the negotiations created a widely perceived linkage between improved offers from the developing countries and a credible signal to foreign investors regarding the attractiveness of that country's territory as a location for investment.;

ID;"ECONOMIC-CRISIS; POLITICS; END";
AB;Rather than seeing the spectacular collapse of stock and currency markets in East and Southeast Asia in 1997-98 as a financial crisis caused by imprudent banking practices and 'crony capitalism,' this article argues that the economic meltdown was a symptom of the collapse of the social coalitions underpinning the developmental states. The first section charts the contours of these social alliances between the late 1940s and the mid 1980s. The second section demonstrates that though the creation of a regional division of labor had enabled these economies to withstand the debt crisis, the progressive trans-border expansion of corporate production and procurement networks rendered national industrial policies increasingly incoherent. It charts how governments were able to paper over cracks in their domestic social alliances through debt-financed industrial expansion till the mid-1990s. Finally, the last section highlights emerging tensions in the different national constellations of power and privilege.;

DE;"capital fixity; capital mobility; cyberspace; international relations; Internet; spatial dialectic";
ID;"TERRITORIALITY; MODERNITY; SYSTEM";
AB;Scholars from a range of perspectives question how the system of sovereign, territorial states is being impacted by the rise of cyberspace, a domain of information flows that apparently transcends state boundaries. Opinions range from those of neorealists who view these flows as posing a fundamental threat to state integrity to neoliberals who view them as one more opportunity for international cooperation. In this article, we hold that both of these views are based upon a liberal conception of space wherein there is a diametric tension between social activities that occur within state territory and those that occur across or outside state boundaries. In contrast, we develop a spatial constructivist perspective wherein spaces of production and consumption and spaces of flows both are viewed as continually being reconstructed amid capitalism's dialectical tendencies toward fixity and mobility. We conclude by suggesting that while the rise of trans-boundary information flows in cyberspace does not represent a new challenge to the state system, it does represent the latest intensification of a long-standing tension, and that efforts to develop a regime that supports both capital fixity and mobility are likely to fall short of their goals.;

DE;"cooperation; regionalism; East Asia; government capacity";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INSTITUTIONS; GROWTH";
AB;Since 1997, cooperation initiatives involving Asian countries have become more visible and ambitious. These initiatives reflect incentives for regional cooperation in Asia that are the product of prior levels of regional integration and international developments. While many countries in the region stand to gain from more substantive cooperation, they are likely to find certain cooperative goals difficult to achieve. This difficulty cannot be ascribed to the commonly cited obstacles to cooperation in Asia: economic diversity, inter-state political rivalry and the influence exercised by the US. Rather, parts of the new regional agenda are complicated by the kind of government organizations that exist in some countries. Government organizations that lack domestic regulatory capacity are poorly equipped to participate in some regional initiatives.;

AB;Various discourses and debates on the state - transnational capital relationship have emerged within the international political economy literature. The particular contribution offered here focuses on this relationship in three East Asian developmental states (Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan - the NIE-3) through the lens of foreign economic policy (FEP) analysis. In different ways their respective state governments have all worked closely alongside various forms of transnational capital in sustained yet evolving 'adaptive partnerships', and in accordance to largely state-determined FEP objectives. Moreover, these objectives broadly relate to the pursuit of economic security in the international system. While each of the NIE-3's own path of economic development has differed significantly, there nevertheless exist important similarities. This not just relates to being constituent to the East Asian regional economic dynamic but also their shared developmental state tradition. The relationship between the state and transnational capital is also key to understanding the NIE-3's foreign economic policy formation, although this has differed significantly across the group. In sum, this study analyses just one of many contemporary examples where both the state and transnational capital are working to congruent ends in their respective adaptations to the challenges posed by globalization.;

DE;"regional integration; institutions; Granger causality; vector autoregression";
ID;"UNITED-STATES; INTERGOVERNMENTALISM; COMMUNITY; POWER; AREA";
AB;This work argues that the formation of an economic union requires that the homogeneity of domestic economic institutions and the process of regional integration reinforce each other. Granger causality tests on four cases of regional integration in the Americas, Asia and Europe (1975 through 1995) confirm our thesis. These cases include the Andean Pact, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Central American Common Market and the European Union. The most successful case of integration - the European Union - does evince a pattern of positive interaction between the two variables, while less successful cases, found in Latin America, are lacking in this mechanism of mutual influence. We further discuss several regional groups that have recently emerged and use our theoretical implications to assess their future development.;

DE;"regionalization; Africa; Mozambique; South Africa; globalization; development";
ID;RENAISSANCE;
AB;The ideology of neo-liberalism. is currently dominant at the elite level. This has profound implications for how development is viewed as best pursued. Currently, a process of regionalization projects, at both the macro- and micro-level, are reconfiguring parts of Africa as the continent's elites seek to promote economic integration as a means of latching onto what is perceived as the globalization juggernaut. However, such processes, and the case of the Maputo Development Corridor (MDC) is provided as a case study, cannot simply be defined as top-down projects to reconfigure spatial areas along neo-liberal lines: globalization and regionalization stimulates reactions involving the re-organization and re-territorialization of spaces in order to meet the challenges posed. Though existing regionalist projects, such as the MDC, reflect the impulses of a neo-liberal world, space for contesting alternatives exists and is nascent, with counter-reactions being continually generated, with diverse forms of regional connectivities being constructed. Analyses of the new regionalisms must be cognisant of such pregnancy within such ongoing processes.;

ID;"LEGALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; CONSEQUENCES; INSTITUTIONS; COOPERATION; MARKETS; POLICY; DESIGN";
AB;This article explores the conditions under which international financial standards succeed. While rationalist accounts treat the successful creation of international standards as a relatively straightforward exercise, I suggest otherwise. The cooperation of private sector agents is a necessary condition for successful standards, and this cooperation hinges on certain elements of institutional design. Using an assessment of the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), I explore issues of institutional design and effectiveness. On the basis of surveys of mutual fund managers and government officials, I argue that because the private sector has yet to become involved fully in the promulgation of the SDDS, the SDDS effort has not yet achieved its goals.;

DT;Article;
DE;"corporate governance; globalization; stock market; shareholder value";
ID;"FINANCIAL-MARKETS; SOCIAL-SYSTEMS; COORDINATION; CAPITALISM; VARIETIES";
AB;Contemporary research on comparative corporate governance was initially preoccupied with the question of differences in national systems of corporate governance. In recent years, however, the focus has shifted to change as some scholars argue that there are growing pressures on national systems of corporate governance to converge on a model that supports an increased focus on shareholder value, that is, a model that closely resembles the US system of corporate governance. In opposition to this view, others predict that systems of corporate governance around the world will continue to diverge. Drawing on the examples of France and Germany I show that considerable change has indeed occurred in national governance systems. Particularly important has been the growing influence of the stock market. Existing theories are inadequate for understanding the political economy of the changes that have taken place in the French and German systems of corporate governance as well as the likelihood that they will continue to evolve in the direction of shareholder value. To support this claim I focus on a common, and fundamental, deficiency in all of the theoretical approaches to the subject, that is, the weakness in their analysis of the relationship between the changing role of the stock market and the productive capabilities of particular national economies.;

DE;"merging markets; financial crisis; financial liberalization; market and institutions";
AB;Emerging economies, which have since the end of the 1980s implemented a process of financial liberalization, are confronted at the same time with a banking crises. The latter highlights the role played by the institutional framework in the process of financial liberalization. The objective of this paper is to go through the usual alternatives of too much/too little market in order to explain that the success of any liberalization process relies on the complementarity between market and intermediation. Institutions, defined as rule-following behaviour, represented the cornerstone of such an evolution. The point is that the solution to financial instability is to be found within the institutional dynamics in which emerging economies may benefit from intermediation in order to enforce the market process.;

DE;"bourgeoisie; development; Marx/Marxism; Daniel'son; Lenin; peasants; shock therapy; agency; property rights; privatization";
AB;In the 1990s, Russian reformers vainly sought to discover a bourgeoisie committed to democracy, productive economic behaviour, and an ever more elusive 'civil society'. Their quest constituted the latest chapter in a centuries'-long struggle that began with the challenge posed by economists like N. F. Daniel'son (Marx's foremost disciple) to 'Orthodox' Marxists and to state capitalists of the tsarist regime. The latter two groups agreed to discount Daniel'son's data on the state-dependent, risk-averse and politically undemocratic behaviour of Russia's bourgeoisie, as well as the statistical and economic evidence that had led Marx to reconsider his skepticism about the role of peasantries in the development process. In the past and in the present, even-handed and unsentimental comparative research on the bourgeoisie as well as other, less privileged economic actors in the development scenario remains - regrettably - quite rare.;

DE;"Gramsci; international political economy; historicism; history of ideas; philosophy of praxis; historical materialism";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS; GLOBALIZATION";
AB;Across debates within political and international theory similar demands have been made concerning the need to 'historicize' the theoretical and practical legacy of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. Yet little attention has been hitherto granted to the substantive ontological and epistemological basis of such demands. By outlining a series of interpretative controversies and examining in detail the question of historicizing Gramsci, this article addresses some of the principal demands to historicize Gramsci before discerning any contemporary relevance. By tackling such demands within their own terms and according to their own stipulations an immanent critique is developed. This tactic of an immanent critique offers an approach to the history of ideas useful to the present, it locates ideas both in and beyond their context, and it also pushes one to consider what might be historically limited in a theoretical and practical translation of past ideas in relation to alternative conditions.;

ID;"EXCHANGE TRADING SCHEMES; LOCAL EXCHANGE; SYSTEMS; MONEY; GLOBALIZATION; WORK";
AB;The last decade has witnessed a remarkable growth of non-state, not-for-profit monetary systems known as community currencies. The Red del Trueque, or 'Barter Network', in Argentina is the first of such systems to grow to a size which encroaches on the state monopoly over the money supply. This article begins with a basic primer on the functioning of the network and offers an explanation for its unprecedented growth in the Argentinean context. The central question addressed is whether the network can be described as petty capitalism, perfecting capitalism or post-capitalism. A socialized theory of economic relations is developed which argues for the existence of a reciprocal relationship between the behavioural norms governing monetary networks and the practices of those networks. Analysis suggests that the RT contains tendencies both supportive of and alternative to capitalist modes of organization, consistent with the history of utopian experiments. To succeed in its goal of creating an 'economy of solidarity', the Barter Network must develop a political alternative to accompany its heterodox economic organization.;

AB;Through a case study of the New Zealand Call Centre Attraction Initiative this paper draws attention to the forms of expertise and knowledge practices through which low wage labour forces are being constituted in the name of 'globalization'. Drawing on the neo-Foucauldian literature on 'governmentality', it identifies the significance of 'post-welfarist' expertise, including human resources companies, training providers, industry associations and information providers, and shows these private sector actors are beginning to usurp the role historically played by state agencies. Close attention is paid to how this expertise is assembled around a particular strategy - the establishment of a toll free number to recruit call centre workers - intended to mobilize mothers, migrants and students, all of whom have been historically marginalized from core labour force participation.;

ID;"ETHICAL TRADE; GARMENT INDUSTRY; LABOR; WORKERS; INTERNATIONALISM; GLOBALIZATION; DISPUTE; LESSONS";
AB;At the present conjuncture there are real opportunities for international trade unions to forge coalitions with other social movements, to foster transnational connections between workers, consumers and intermediaries, and to engage directly with global employers in order to bargain for workers. As companies declare their support for ethical practice in production and trade, a number of global union federations have seized the opportunity to sign International Framework Agreements with trans-national companies. These agreements secure commitments on the part of TNCs to respect workers' rights. The agreement between the French-owned global hotel chain Accor and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) is explored in this paper. The Accor-IUF agreement has proved critical in supporting union organizing efforts in the USA, Canada and Indonesia. It has also allowed the IUF close involvement in trade union organization in Australia, in educational activities in Africa and Asia-Pacific, and in efforts to start organizing work in the UK and New Zealand. By integrating the international agreement into the operation of the European Works Council, the IUF has also found a means to overcome the geographical parochialism of many such bodies. This paper argues that such international agreements are an excellent way to defend and advance workers' rights in the global economy while also allowing trade unions to develop a sophisticated multi-scalar response to the challenges of globalization.;

AB;This paper presents a comparative analysis of three tropical commodity chains, for a set of commodities often grouped together as the tropical beverages: coffee, cocoa and tea. The analysis demonstrates the ways in which the structures of these chains reinforce the north-south dimension of international inequality and help to explain its persistence over time. It focuses on attempts by actors in the producing regions to move forward into the more advanced processing stages of the chains, in order to realize higher returns from their commodity exports. Comparisons across commodity chains identify structural features of the chains that set limits on, and open possibilities for, forward integration. Features considered include economies of scale in the early processing stages and the stage at which intermediate products first become storable and transportable. Comparisons across countries within commodity chains identify additional factors that help to explain successes or failures in individual cases: forms of state action, the strength of the local capitalist class and the size of the domestic market. Control over the consumption end of the commodity chain by transnational corporations is the most important factor limiting the benefits derived from forward integration strategies.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"debt; warfare; Uganda; state building; plunder; reform";
AB;The return of interstate war in Africa after the end of the cold war and global awareness of predatory economic motivations for war raises the question of whether African states are reviving early modern European methods of building states. This study of Uganda's intervention in Congo reveals that this is not so. Uganda's peripheral position in the world economy, coupled with its relations with creditors, gives its leaders unexpected capabilities to plunder a neighbouring country's resources. Creditors remain surprisingly willing to tolerate this behaviour, while providing debt relief. Uganda's leaders exploit creditor anxieties about growing disorder among highly indebted countries and fears that chaos will undermine creditor efforts to manage uncollectable debt. Nonetheless, warfare, plunder and manipulation of creditor interests does not result in stronger institutions. The predatory behaviour of the Ugandan military resembles that of their state-building counterparts. But contemporary plunderers form their own ties to the world economy. Uganda's leader faces greater obstacles to consolidating control over violent commerce, and private interests of plunderers actually weakens existing central political control as Uganda's leaders and its creditors become even more tied to new loans to maintain short-term order.;

AB;This article outlines a framework for the analysis of economic integration and its relation to the asymmetries of economic and social development. Consciously breaking with state-centric forms of social science, it argues for a research agenda that is more adequate to the exigencies and consequences of globalization than has traditionally been the case in 'development studies'. Drawing on earlier attempts to analyse the cross-border activities of firms, their spatial configurations and developmental consequences, the article moves beyond these by proposing the framework of the 'global production network' (GPN). It explores the conceptual elements involved in this framework in some detail and then turns to sketch a stylized example of a GPN. The article concludes with a brief indication of the benefits that could be delivered by research informed by GPN analysis.;

AB;Over the past 30 years, subnational states have become significant global economic actors, yet they remain unincorporated into the main body of IPE research. This is largely because their relevance has been sought in the narrowly defined local economic milieu, when instead their real significance lies in their emergence as sites of regulation of the global political economy. In particular, through efforts to attract transnational corporate investment and create transnational business networks, sell exporting to small and medium firms, and imagineer local metropolises into 'world cities', subnational states become the structural site around which the local social foundations of transnational liberalism are built. As national Fordist blocs composed of national capital and nationally organized labour erode, a new hegemonic bloc in the Gramscian sense is emergent, organized not simply globally or locally but glocally. Such blocs have the potential to join transnational capital, small and medium manufacturers and farmers, and the consumption-oriented metropolitan middle class in and through the subnational state into a social formation supportive of the transnational liberal project. This is a key element in the re-scaling of the state and the production of new geographies of global regulation in the twenty-first century.;

TI;A historical materialist account of the Chilean capital control: prototype policy for whom?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;After the tumultuous 1990s, capital controls are making a comeback. Although about 14 emerging markets have implemented capital constraints, the Chilean variant (1991-8) has drawn the most attention. Many scholars and policymakers, especially of the Keynesian variant, are quick to support country-level capital controls as a useful device to quell further socioeconomic devastation largely brought about by the speculative activities institutional investors. While this is an important concern, their analyses tend to treat capital controls as ready-made, technical policy instruments usually devoid of political and historical considerations. On the contrary, the Chilean case demonstrates that capital controls can form one moment of larger accumulation strategies from which a minority of the population benefits. By examining the Chilean control through the lens of historical materialism, this essay attempts not only to provide a more rigorous and critical scrutiny but also seeks to 'politicize' this seemingly neutral policy. In doing so, the essay suggests that the URR was not a means to an end, but rather an integral moment of a larger class-based strategy - paradoxically named 'growth with equity' - that was designed to stabilize and reproduce a development model, which serves the interests of powerful transnational financial capitals and industrial conglomerates.;

AB;Globalization is changing MNEs' nonmarket environments in four ways. First, instead of a 'retreat' of the state across sectors, it is leading to deregulation as well as reregulation. Because cross-border mergers and acquisitions are creating global oligopolies, there is increased antitrust scrutiny, thereby creating opportunities for governments to employ competition policy as a non-tariff barrier. Second, since MNEs retain national identities and 'first-movers' appropriate significant profits, governments have incentives to influence nonmarket environments in favour of their home-based MNEs. Third, many citizen groups that oppose MNEs have acquired a broad array of cross-border competencies (not merely country-specific). Their collective opposition is significantly aided by the Internet and by their abilities to manage the media. Fourth, since media is now significantly globalized, local nonmarket issues quickly acquire supranational dimensions. Thus, to respond to these changes, MNEs can be expected to simultaneously develop multi-domestic and supranational (regional and global) nonmarket strategies.;

TI;Between two coordination failures: automotive industrial policy in China with a comparison to Korea;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"automotive industry; industrial policy; political economy; bureaucracy; administrative guidance; scale economies";
AB;Since 1985, China has attempted to re-structure its automotive industry through an industrial policy approach closely modelled on that of Korean government in the 1970s. While the growth of the automotive industry has been impressive, government's consolidation attempt has been a failure. The size of the Chinese firm is small in a sector with well-known economy of scale (FOS) features and even the largest firm operates below minimum efficient scale. This article analyses the reasons why government in Korea could enforce EOS-enhancing policies in the 1970s and 1980s while the Chinese government, with similar policies, has not been able to do so. The argument is that the success of automotive industrial policy (AIP) requires two necessary components. One is to overcome a coordination failure on the part of the firms to invest at less than a socially optimal level. This is the familiar form of market failure and is known as Coordination Failure 1 (CF1) in this article. The other is to overcome a coordination failure on the part of the firms to invest excessively. This is known as Coordination Failure 2 (CF2). CF2 is more costly to overcome than CF1 in institutional terms and China's divided and decentralized bureaucratic arrangements have made it difficult for government to overcome CF2.;

DT;Article;
DE;"hegemony; multilateralism; US Treasury; World Bank; IMF; finance; civil society";
AB;"Hegemony refers to a dominant group's ability to make others want the same thing as it wants for itself. It rests upon (1) a substantive pillar of belief that the system of rule created by the dominant group brings material and other benefits to all or most participants and that the feasible alternatives are worse, and (2) a procedural pillar of belief that the processes and procedures of the dominant system of rule are fair and appropriate and will be enforced on the dominant group as well as the subordinate group. But the requirements of (1) and (2) may undermine each other this is the hegemon's dilemma. US intervention in multilateral organizations to strengthen the substantive pillar - the organizations' commitment to the idea of mutual benefits from free markets - may come at the expense of the procedural pillar, by breaking collectively legitimated rules of, for example, personnel selection or research independence; and vice versa. This paper explores US-World Bank relations in the context of US efforts to influence the statements made by the incumbents of two important ideas-controlling positions in the World Bank, the chief economist and the director of the World Development Report. It takes the firing of chief economist Joseph Stiglitz and the resignation of director of the World Development Report 2000, Ravi Kanbur, as case studies. It draws broader conclusions about how hegemony actually works, about the extent of World Bank autonomy, and about the debate on development agendas.";

Prior to the crisis, regionalism in the area was noted for its relative lack of formal institutions; many analyses stressed the role of private businesses in fostering a 'regional economy'. Post-crisis regionalism is being led by the state and encompasses both monetary and trade dimensions. The reasons for this change are analysed and the regional policies of China and Japan examined. The spur to post-crisis regionalism is argued to have been provided by a desire to limit the influence in the region of the US and the international financial institutions.";

TI;The reconstruction of the International Financial Architecture: Keynes' revenge?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"International Financial Architecture; Keynes; neo-liberalism; financial crises; International Monetary Fund";
AB;Faced with the gravity of the financial crises which occurred in Mexico and, above all, in Asia, the objective of the new financial architecture as defined by the G7 and the IMF is to control international financial instability. However, many questions remain. Is it merely a question of improving the transparency of information in order to encourage better financial practice or of introducing much stricter rules while accepting the principle of limiting the international mobility of capital? If such questions arise, it is because there is no theoretical consensus over the dysfunction that was observed on the international financial markets in the 1990s. Paradoxically, this leads us to reconsider the work and theoretical heritage left to us by Keynes. Discussions about international monetary and financial governance recall the debate raised by Keynes, first of all in his Treatise on Money, about improvements to the gold standard system, and then when preparing for the Bretton Woods Conference. Could this new financial architecture not be seen as Keynes' revenge? In fact, the new architecture is a working compromise which brings together neo-Keynesian and neo-liberal principles but which cannot fully answer the challenges of systemic risk.;

DE;"regulation theory; state restructuring; state rescaling; political legitimacy; welfare politics";
ID;"LOCAL GOVERNANCE; SOCIAL-CONTRACT; FLEXIBLE SPECIALIZATION; URBAN GOVERNANCE; GLOBALIZATION; WELFARE; SCALE; LEGITIMACY; CAPITALISM; GOVERNMENT";
AB;This paper offers a critique of the recent work on global economic and state restructuring in the broader political economy literature. It argues that much of this work, because of its theoretical reliance on regulation theory, offers only a partial account of the state and state restructuring. The paper offers a framework for understanding state restructuring and the state's role in economic regulation that adds more explicitly political imperatives to the existing regulation account. The methodological goals of the regulationist literature have led it to focus too heavily on the reproduction of capitalist relations as the primary object of state policies and institutions. That focus should be enlarged to include an explicit analysis of the important element of state-citizen relations. In addition to helping reproduce capitalist relations, state policies must also reproduce a condition of political legitimacy between state and citizen in order to ensure the continued reproduction of state institutions and state sovereignty. While the state-citizen relation is closely bound up with economic relations, it also includes non-economic, more purely political aspects. I argue that the imperative of state-citizen legitimacy will play an important role in how the state is restructured in the present crisis. The paper ends by offering a case study of the local state in Los Angeles in order to illustrate how state-citizen political legitimacy can play an important role in state restructuring.;

ID;"STATE ENTERPRISES; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CHINESE; PRODUCTIVITY; TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; SPILLOVERS; INNOVATION";
AB;This paper explores some aspects of China's strive for accelerating the rate of technical progress taking place in its economy. The first part analyses the evolution of the Chinese R&D system. On one hand there is a drive towards the commercialization and decentralization, and on the other hand increased emphasis is being put on a new generation of national research programmes. The efficiency of China's R&D had increased, but a major reorientation of resources towards research activities has yet to materialize.;
;The second part focuses on the reform of public industrial enterprises. As a result of the boom of collective-owned enterprises and of the partial improvements in the state-owned sub-sector, in which property relations are undergoing major changes, the innovative capacity and the technological level of Chinese public industry have advanced markedly. The growth in total factor productivity and the evolution in the export structure suggest that substantial technical progress has been taking place.;
;The paper concludes that China's experience so far shows that a radical improvement in a socialist economy's ability to achieve technical progress is not inconsistent with the reafirmation, in a new and diversified form, of a fundamentally public framework of property relations.;

DE;"structural adjustment; privatization in Russia; international organizations; development economics";
AB;Ten years ago, John Williamson of the Institute for International Economics summarized a recipe for structural adjustment in Latin America into ten ingredients. According to Williamson the recipe was 'generally applicable' elsewhere, and universally agreed upon in Washington institutions. However, the Washington Consensus is increasingly under attack from different camps. We discuss the Russian crisis in August 1998 as a case history of the breakdown of the Consensus among economists, within and outside the international organizations. While several economists have contributed to the current critical mood, we focus on how Joseph Stiglitz, then chief economist at the World Bank, reacted to the Russian crisis, before his resignation at the end of the same year. We contrast his views with those of other economists at the IMF and other international organizations. Looking at this debate, we suggest that the Russian crisis, following the Asian crisis in the previous year, marked a watershed of intellectual perceptions, gave voice to dissenters, and openly broke the Consensus within international organizations. We also discuss the reasons for and implications of this change in the intellectual climate within the economic profession.;

DE;"political economy of violence and security; asymmetric war; humanitarian intervention; politics of representation; politics of containment";
ID;"MODERNITY; VIOLENCE; MIND";
AB;How does globalization affect the politics of conflict and security? This treatment concentrates on three themes: technology, geopolitics of globalization and asymmetric conflict. Focusing on technology serves to shift the attention from globalization events to the infrastructure of globalization, which is shaped by parallel changes in technologies of work, war and politics. Considering violence means zeroing in on the dark side of globalization: how is it that the era of accelerated globalization is so deeply mired in politics of containment? Focusing on conflict and security shows the Janus faces of globalization. A point where key dimensions-technologies, the political economy of violence, geopolitics of globalization intersect is asymmetric conflict, or conflict and security across development and technology gaps. East-West politics of containment have turned North-South and ideological justifications and strategies of conflict management have changed accordingly. The closing section considers counterpoints in conflict management.;

TI;Critical responses to neoliberal globalization in the Mercosur region: roads towards cosmopolitan democracy?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
DE;"globalization; transnational neoliberalism; Latin America; civic public space; trans-regionalism; cosmopolitan democracy";
AB;Thus far, the most articulate political theoretical response to the process of globalization is the theory of cosmopolitan democracy: given our democratic ideals and aspirations, globalization requires us to rethink the political community within which these ideals and aspirations can be realized. The problem of many models of cosmopolitan democracy, such as David Held's, is that they are partially detached from the real world historical processes. In this paper, we take a step towards correcting this bias. In the Mercosur region of Latin America, neoliberal globalization has led and will lead to a variety of critical political responses, some of which carry the seeds of cosmopolitan democracy. In Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil, it seems that there has occurred a dialectical development of political consciousness to tackle directly the real conditions of people's lives.;
;After defining our basic concepts-globalization, democracy and civic public spaces-we develop a categorization of different trans- and supra-national responses to globalization. Our empirical research indicates the need to redefine the conceptual basis for cosmopolitan democracy in political economy terms. For the actors in the Mercosur region, the most pressing priorities have to do with tackling the problems caused by financial globalization and the repressive governance of the globalising economy. However, instead of legalist blueprints, there seems to be a quest for more imaginative and context-sensitive (radical) reforms.;

AB;This paper develops and tests explanations of the motivations that drove the process of economic integration known as Mercosur (Southern Cone Common Market). The hypotheses tested are those that focus on elite considerations of geo-political, political economic and domestic politics factors when deciding to participate in international economic integration. We find that policy elite in Mercosur member states have been primarily driven by domestic political considerations when they have furthered the integration process. This leads to the conclusion that Mercosur is not likely to develop the kinds of supranational governance institutions present in the European Union, as policy elites in Mercosur member states desire to maintain a great deal of domestic policy autonomy.;

AB;"The concept of globalization of innovation is the zip between two fundamental phenomena of modern economies: the increased international integration of economic activities and the raising importance of knowledge in economic processes. The paper singles out three different components of the globalization of innovation: (1) the international exploitation of nationally generated innovations; (2) the global generation of innovations by MNEs; and (3) global techno-scientific collaborations. Empirical evidence on these three categories is here presented, suggesting that the relevance of global forces in innovation is rapidly increasing, although at a different pace for each of the three ongoing processes.";

DE;"regional economic cooperation; ASEAN; AICO; industrial development; Japanese firms; automobile industry";
ID;"PACIFIC; ASIA";
AB;This article examines the development of regional economic integration in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region by highlighting preferences and activities of foreign multinational corporations (MNCs). The main hypothesis of this study is that as foreign MNCs operating in small local markets seek larger markets in order to achieve an efficient production level, they raise their preferences for regional economic arrangements, and that these preferences function as critical factors promoting regional economic integration. The case of the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) arrangement revealed the complex relationship between the states' interests and MNCs' preferences. In 1996, Japanese auto MNCs, which hoped to increase production volume of plants located in the small market, successfully encouraged the ASEAN states to introduce the AICO arrangement that granted tariff reductions and local content accreditation. However, the arrangement did not work effectively after its introduction because of the states' adherence to maintaining the national interests, seeking to increase the benefits for their local economies and firms. The ASEAN members relaxed regulations concerning AICO applications after the Asian economic crisis. This policy change stemmed from auto MNCs' persistent pressure for the smooth implementation of the scheme, mixed with the states' renewed recognition of the AICO as a vehicle to promote regional economic cooperation and further inward investment.;

DE;"globalization; leadership long cycle; new economy; leading sectors; K-waves; Internet";
ID;"INNOVATION; RETURN; RATES";
AB;Most authors analysing the 'New Economy' study it as an isolated phenomenon. This approach, however, misses the continued significance of structural economic and socio-political fundamentals, both domestically and within the world economy. This paper examines the current changes in the global economic environment in a historical and structural context and identifies change as a pattern constantly discernible in at least the past 1, 000 years. The changes leading to the New Economy are neither unique in a historical context, nor do they represent the end of the nation state and its role in the global economy. Instead, the changes represent a common pattern observed over an extended period of time. A convincing framework to study and explain the question of economic and political global leadership in the course of history is the leadership long cycle paradigm. The paper identifies the Internet as the new leading sector of the nineteenth K-wave and the US as the country most likely to be the old and new leading economy in the world economic and political system.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"neoliberalism; finance; crisis; monetary policy; interest rates; class";
AB;Neoliberalism is the ideological expression of the return to hegemony of the financial fraction of ruling classes. The meaning of this movement can only be understood from a historical perspective. Modern finance, linked to he real economy, appeared in the wake of the structural crisis of the late nineteenth century. It lost its unrivalled domination, when the Keynesian compromise was ushered in by the succession of the great depression and World War II. Its return to power followed the crisis which began in the 1970s. The class character of neoliberalism is evident from an examination of the available figures. It prolonged the deficient profit rates of non-financial corporations and, thus, slow growth and unemployment. It was responsible for the deficits and the growing indebtedness of the states, as well as for the crisis of the debt of Third World countries, etc. But not enough attention has been paid to the benefits that finance gleaned from its return to hegemony during the crisis: the stunning rise of the profits and growth of the financial sector, only delayed in the US by the banking and thrift crises of the 1980s. It is not that finance organized to minimize its own costs during the crisis. It actually benefited from the crisis in amazing proportions, already during the crisis as in France, or after as in the US financial sector. One should not underestimate the sufferings of the unemployed and homeless, or of Third-world countries. But perhaps the biggest cost stemming from the rise of finance is the increase in the domestic and international instability.;

ID;"INSTITUTIONS; FOUNDATIONS; POLICY; STATE";
AB;What is foreign aid? This deceptively simple question has not been adequately addressed because aid scholars have tended to emphasize practitioners' concerns and thus have favoured the conceptualization of foreign aid in terms of security or development policy objectives. This article attempts to reconceptualize foreign aid in a larger systemic context of international relations, focusing first on the nature and conditions of the key social relation involved in foreign aid practice and then on specifying it functions and effects. It argues that what most clearly defines foreign aid is the symbolic power politics between donor and recipient. Aid practice transforms material dominance and subordination into gestures of generosity and gratitude. This symbolic transformation, in turn, euphemizes the material hierarchy underlying the donor-recipient relation, In this process, recipients become complicit in the existing order that enables donors to give in the first place.;

AB;Traditional economic wisdom claims that - while global economic integration is beneficial for economic performance - a country's trade specialization pattern has no impact on its economic performance. In this paper, we seek to cast doubt on this aspect of mainstream economics using a very traditional approach. We introduce a simple endogenous growth model that shows how governments can stimulate economic growth by implementing policies that successfully create competitive advantages in favourable sectors. According to new growth theory, favourable sectors inhibit technological spill-over effects to the non-tradable sector. The model is supported by the data. Using a standard augmented aggregate production function we run a series of growth regressions including technological change and a proxy for trade specialization. Our results indicate that contrary to conventional wisdom export specialization matters: sectors are not indistinguishable in their impact on economic performance. The paper concludes with a broader discussion of policy implications.;

AB;In the literature on international political economy, some approaches to long-term economic growth and global political-economic leadership assume the intermittent presence of a singular lead economy. Among other things, the lead economy generates radical innovations in commercial and industrial leading sectors that serve as a platform for global political leadership. The innovations drive the lead economy's own growth, diffuse to the rest of the world, and drive the growth of the world economy. While others have demonstrated that lead economies monopolize the production of radical innovations, for the first time we test the empirical relationships among one lead economy's leading sectors, its aggregate growth, and the growth of the world economy. Focusing on the 1870-1990 US experience, we find that US leading sector activity and aggregate growth both drive world economic growth. These relationships wax and wane according to the life cycles of leading sector innovations and the intermittency of economic leadership. The basic point is that economics is and has been a global process influenced by first the concentration and then the diffusion of major innovations via the agency of political-economic leadership in the world economy.;

DE;"globalization; rule of law; labour law; labour standards; imperialism";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; STANDARDS; RIGHTS; GLOBALIZATION; LAW";
AB;The US is now the most important political force on the world scene calling for the establishment of transnational labour protections as a means of 'humanizing' the ongoing globalization of the capitalist economy. This paper raises critical questions about the US advocacy of transnational labour standards and norms by critically examining the existing system of US transnational labour protections. By means of a survey of different forms of transnational labour protections presently endorsed by the US, the paper argues that their internal legal weaknesses - in particular, their failure to institutionalize the minimal rudiments of modern formal legality - render them at best ineffective and at worst an instrument for attempts to assure the political and economic hegemony of the US, especially in those parts of the world in which the US has traditionally played a dominant role. Notwithstanding the understandable appeal of transnational labour standards, the US model of transnational labour protections represents a false humanitarianism which thus far has born few fruits for labour either in the US or abroad.;

DE;"currency crises; institutional investors; Polanyi; ERM crisis; peso crisis; East Asian crisis";
ID;POLICY;
AB;This article constructs a model of contemporary currency crises which incorporates the role played by institutional investors and the dynamics associated with Karl Polanyi's notion of the 'double movement'. Polanyi's double movement, and its recognition of the need to integrate politics with economics, is used to explain why so many governments are prone to pursue policies that lead to a speculative attack against fixed exchange rates and why virtually every modern fixed exchange rate regime has ended in crisis. Evidence on the short-term and herd behaviour of institutional investors is used to explain why contemporary currency crises do not appear to be justified by underlying economic fundamentals and why these crises do so much more damage than their earlier counterparts. The model is then applied to the 1992 European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis, the 1994 Mexican peso crisis and the 1997 East Asian crisis. While recognizing that variations exist in the specific circumstances of each episode, the argument of this article is that the progression of events do seem to conform to the model presented.;

TI;Who triggered the Asian financial crisis?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Asian currency crisis; international finance; institutional investors; capital flows; commercial banks; Japan";
AB;The Asian financial crisis was triggered by Japanese commercial banks who reduced their exposure to Asia in response to emerging troubles in Thailand and South Korea. Japanese banks had been severely weakened by the collapse of the real estate and stock market bubble in Japan in 1990. As the largest lenders in Asia and the key creditor in Thailand, Japanese banks signalled the change in sentiment to other foreign commercial banks who also withdrew their loans. These capital outflows triggered a devaluation in Thailand in mid-1997, but not in Korea until late 1997, due to the different exchange rate regimes in these countries. Despite the devaluation and outflow of bank loans, bond investors continued to provide capital to Asian borrowers until November 1997, at spreads which did not reflect the risks involved. By 1998, foreign equity investors were returning to these markets in search of bargains. Rather than rushing to the exits in a herd-like fashion, institutional investors made investment decisions which created off-setting private capital flows. This analysis suggests that more attention should be paid to the incentives facing institutional investors and the design of domestic institutions, rather than to the need for a new financial architecture.;

DE;"critical theory; ideas of ownership; legal institutions; intellectual property rights; technology; TRIPs agreement";
ID;"AUTHORSHIP; RIGHTS";
AB;Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are increasingly recognized as the key economic resource of the future. This has led to considerable discussion of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement which was brokered during the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. In this article we present an analysis of a number of key 'moments' in the history of IPRs which eventually led to this particular agreement. We utilize a 'triangulation' between technological history, legal institutional developments and the changes in the understanding of what it means to own ideas to explore the long history of IPRs. Our explicit aim is to establish that the settlement codified in the TRIPs agreement is not the final 'improvement' to legislation governing IPRs or the cumulation of a history of legal rationalization. Rather, the TRIPs agreement is based on a particular constellation of political power and as such remains contested and open to amendment through political engagement.;

ID;"CAPITALISM; FORDISM; POLICY; TRADE";
AB;This article looks at an old subject (the state of the state) under new conditions (accelerating globalization and fragmentation), using Canada as the case in point.;
;My first concern is linguistic: such labels as 'post-Keynesian', 'post-welfare', and even 'post-national' tell us more about what the state may have been than what it has become. These 'post-' categories do not capture the extent to which governmental functions have been redistributed - upward to international institutions, downward to sub-national states, and laterally to the private sector. Nor do they direct our attention to the dynamic interconnections that are linking evolving governmental forms with civil society.;
;I go on to consider to what extent these difficulties can be resolved by considering the 'state' as a nested, multi-tiered set of institutions providing governance on five levels - from the municipal and the regional, through the national to the continental and global. Political economy analysis of the dynamic that links these levels of governance with civil society and transnational market forces may tell us better than the post-it labels that the present capability of the Canadian, or any other, state is less bleak than it may have seemed.;

ID;"AGRARIAN DOCTRINES; STATE; GLOBALIZATION";
AB;This article critically analyses recent innovations in the World Bank's thinking on administrative reform as part of a broader set of notions contained within the international 'governance agenda'. It is argued that the Bank's administrative reform literature generates a discourse of liberal populism. Liberal populism keys in with i) a fundamental belief in the free market as a means towards development and stability, and ii) recent innovations towards inclusion, participation and stakeholding which are prominent in the administrative reform literature. The article finishes by relating this discourse to the political economy of structural adjustment and indebtedness to suggest that this discourse might be subject to the same processes of revision and selective abandonment that have characterized many other Bank prioritizations over the decades.;

ID;CURRENCY COMPETITION;
AB;The era of electronic money will soon be upon us, What will the advent of electronic money mean for the capacity of central banks to sustain price stability and promote growth? This article begins with a basic primer on the essential characteristics of electronic money what it is, how it operates, and what it is likely to look like in the future. The rise of electronic money, it is clear, is no anomaly in historical terms and indeed may be regarded as an entirely natural development in the context of today's rapidly globalizing world economy. Analysis suggests that the challenge of e-money differs significantly depending on what countries we are talking about. In the many economies around the world where central bankers are already experiencing increased difficulty in controlling monetary aggregates, owing to accelerating cross-border competition among currencies, the main impact of electronic money will be simply to add to the intensity of that competition. By contrast, in the traditional reserve centres-the US, 'Euroland' (home of the new euro), and Japan-the threat to state power appears distinctly greater and will demand real adjustments by policymakers.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
DE;"capital accumulation; globalization; mergers and acquisitions; stagflation; power";
ID;"CAPITALIST CLASS; TAKEOVERS; ECONOMY";
AB;The paper offers a new approach for analysing capitalist development and crisis, tying together mergers and acquisitions, stagflation and globalization as integral facets of accumulation. The framework builds on the concept of differential accumulation, emphasizing the power drive by dominant capital groups to beat the average and exceed the normal rate of return. Four regimes of differential accumulation are articulated: internal breadth by amalgamation, external breadth through green-field investment, internal depth via cost-cutting, and external depth through stagflation. The complex relationships between these different regimes, as well as their broader societal implications, are analysed in light of the US experience over the past century. Several broad conclusions emerge. (1) Of the four regimes, the most important are amalgamation and stagflation, which tend to oscillate inversely to each other. (2) Over the longer haul, amalgamation grows exponentially relative to green-field investment, contributing to the stagnation tendency of modern capitalism. (3) The wave-like pattern of mergers and acquisitions reflects the progressive break-up of socioeconomic envelopes', as dominant capital moves through successive amalgamation at the industry, sectoral, national, and, finally, global level. In this sense, the current global merger wave is an integral facet of differential accumulation. (4) Periodic lulls in amalgamation tend to be compensated for by stagflation, which arrears as a crisis at the societal level, but which contributes significantly to differential accumulation at the disaggregate level. An end to the present worldwide merger boom could therefore trigger global stagflation. (5) Stagflation crises have been previously 'resolved' when dominant capital broke its existing envelope, pushing to amalgamate within a broader universe of takeover targets. Given that there is nothing more to conquer beyond the global envelope, future stagflation crises may prove much more difficult to tame.;

This process evolved through an initial phase of conservative, sphere-of-interest policies in which the particularities of the different Western states prevailed over any common posture; to a US-led offensive eventually drawing all Atlantic states into common forward movement into Eastern Europe, extending Washington's influence as far as central Asia. Structural differences in sectoral and world market orientation between capitals predisposed particular states to different policies through these phases. Ultimately, the European states representing regional economic interests were brought into line by the offensive approach under Clinton. The offensive exposed structural weaknesses of continental European capital as much as the failure of the European left governments to pursue an alternative to neoliberalism.";

TI;Assembling restructuring: governmentality, economic regulation and the historical emergence of the 'enterprising farmer' in Australian agricultural policy;

DT;Article;
DE;"governmentality; restructuring; economic reform; farmers; agricultural policy; Australia";
ID;"STATE; GLOBALIZATION; POLITICS";
AB;In the last 15 years the term 'restructuring' has been used by scholars from a wide range of disciplines to explain the economic and social changes experienced within Australia and other Western nations. While these analyses have been productive in accounting for restructuring in terms of the historical structural relations between fractions of capital and the state, this paper argues for an understanding of the more subtle ways through which programmes of economic reform are assembled at the state level. Using the Foucauldian-inspired literature on governmentality, the paper draws attention-through a historical analysis of the emergence in Australian political discourse of formal managerial skills-to the specific rationalities and technologies of governing that enable particular forms of 'restructuring' to be constituted and assembled into a programmatic form. The emergence of farm business management, as a means of improving agricultural productivity, is conceptualized as embedded within a series of problematizations of governing. These problematizations sought to constitute the national economy as in a state of crisis, and previous forms of governing as failing to enhance the capacities of farmers to compete internationally. On this basis, the managerial capacities of farmers emerged as the proper sites through which to pursue 'reform'.;

DE;"world economy; US economy; economic crisis; economic history; long wave; economic stagnation";
AB;This paper addresses the question of whether the long stagnation that gripped the world economy for a quarter century after 1973 has been transcended. To do so, it offers an account of the long downturn, in terms of the fall and failure of recovery of the profitability, especially in the international manufacturing sector, itself rooted in the rise and persistence of over-capacity and over-production on a system-wide scale, originating in the intensification of international competition between 1965 and 1973. Ln that context, it finds the source of the current boom in the US in a recovery of manufacturing profitability between 1985 and 1995. But, because the US recovery came heavily at the expense of profitability and economic dynamism elsewhere, leaving the underlying problem of international over-capacity and over-production unresolved, it raises the question of the boom's sustainability, especially in light of the fact that the beginnings of manufacturing recovery in Japan and Germany after 1995 led to the East Asian crisis and new profitability problems in the US. Rapid expansion in the US has thus been driven most recently by fast-growing consumption, rooted in the stock market bubble and the associated growth of debt, so its future remains in doubt.;

AB;Many of the world's population have gained from the globalization of product markets. At the same time the numbers living in absolute poverty have remained stubbornly large and inter- and intra-country income distribution has worsened as globalization has proceeded. Two outcomes to globalization are analysed - a positive-sum 'blue scenario' of full employment and effective redistributive mechanisms, and a 'red scenario' of a growing global reserve army of skilled workers, and the weakness of political processes favouring redistributive mechanisms. The conclusion is that the negative-sum red scenario is the most likely outcome of the unequalizing tendencies of globalization. The role which China plays in the creation of this global reserve army of labour - especially of skilled labour - is given particular attention.;

ID;SHAREHOLDER VALUE;
AB;This payer presents a Keynesian analysis of accumulation under conditions of inequality in the UK and USA where household savings are channelled into corporate securities. This form of saving is dominated by the comfortable classes in upper income households whose behaviour indirectly encourages the UK and USA corporate sectors into merger and acquisition. A broader discussion of trajectory and results brings out the risk of instability in a coupon pool type of capitalism where the stock market operates like a giant Ponzi scheme. in the UK and US cases, the policy implication is that it is foolish to give the stock market a larger role in provision for retirement through schemes which encourage or enforce increased savings by lower income groups.;

However, from the 1990s, financialization has involved the attenuation of this form of welfare with pressures to improve shareholder value restricting its score. Focusing on health insurance and occupational pensions in the UK and the USA this article seeks to explore the trajectory of occupational welfare iii both phases and the distinctive political responses to that trajectory as a social democratic politics has been displaced by a repositioned centre-left focused on a 'third way'.;

It focuses on Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea - the countries most severely affected by the 1997 crisis. It concludes that: (1) globalization is potentially reversible in some issue areas, provided there is the political will to do so; (2) states continue to matter in economic activity; (3) the new system of global commerce and finance must ensure accountability at various levels without undermining the democratic bases of the polity.";

DE;"information technology; globalization; inequality; developing countries";
AB;While recognizing the importance of a wide range of influences on current patterns of globalization in developing countries, this paper focuses on the role played by information technologies of various kinds. It is argued that these technologies are associated with a number of powerful cumulative mechanisms causing some countries to grow rapidly and others to become increasingly marginalized from the global economy. These differential effects of information technology on patterns of globalization are better viewed from the perspective of Myrdal's notion of cumulative causation than from the standpoint of standard economic theory.;

AB;The creation of a pan-European stock market (EASDAQ) aimed at the entrepreneurial, high-growth company sector is a significant capital market and institutional innovation in Europe. Despite its similarity to the American NASDAQ market, EASDAQ (which began trading in late 1996) is not the outcome of a causal story about institutional convergence, driven by efficiency pressures that accompany the 'globalization' of finance. Nor is it a result of convergence around an emerging hegemony of ideas proselytized by private and public financial institutions. Rather, EASDAQ is primarily a political innovation, deeply embedded in the political economy of European integration, with the European Commission as the prime mover. We stress the creative and catalytic role of the European Commission in driving institutional innovation that has now set off a much broader wave of change in European finance.;

DT;Article;
DE;"globalization; risk; IPE; uncertainty; boundaries; knowledge";
AB;This article examines notions of globalization through the conceptual lens of risk. Adapting the framework employed by Frank H. Knight, the article identifies three variables that help to explain how the role of risk and risk management is understood across a variety of (often antagonistic) literatures on globalization - these variables are boundaries, knowledge and organization. The article examines how three broadly distinct approaches to globalization - hyperglobal, state focused and the so-called Third Way - can be examined through competing conceptions of risk. In so doing, the article seeks to understand how prevailing ideas about globalization advance specific accounts of the risk-induced choices of actors - whether states, firms or individuals - within the political economies of modern societies.;

AB;The study of institutions and innovativeness is presently high on the agenda of the social sciences. There is increasing concern with how a society's innovativeness is associated with its international competitiveness. And as scholars study why the innovative styles of societies vary there has been increasing concern with how the institutional makeup of a society influences its particular style of innovativeness. However, before there can be significant advance in the study of this problem, it is important that we have a better understanding of what constitutes institutional analysis. Every social science discipline - with the exception of psychology - has at least one distinctive strategy for doing institutional analysis. And it is because of the lack of consensus as to the appropriate boundaries and content of institutional analysis that we have limited ability to make theoretical advances in understanding how the institutional makeup of a society impacts on its innovativeness. Recognizing that this is a serious problem for the social sciences, this article attempts to structure the field of institutional analysis and takes the first steps in relating it to the study of a society's style of innovativeness.;

ID;CAPITALISM;
AB;This article proposes an institutional analysis of modern capitalist economies. It argues that the institutional dimension is crucial if one wants to account for the coexistence of different types of modern developed economies, characterized by substantially different institutional structures. It explains why no generalized pattern of convergence towards the same economic model should be expected, in spite of 'globalization'. An institutional analysis of modern economies, or social systems of innovation and production, can be made using the concepts of complementarity and hierarchy of institutions. Institutional arrangements are complementary to each other and thus define the coherence as well as the potential for evolution of the various economies. The hierarchy of institution expresses which part of the institution drives the others, and is helpful for understanding historical evolutions. The article proposes a classification of developed economies and draws some conclusions regarding the usefulness of the concepts of complementarity and hierarchy of institutions for economic policy.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"innovation systems; multinationals; R&D; learning region; NAFTA; Canada";
ID;"RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; LEARNING REGION; INTERNATIONALIZATION; GLOBALIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; FIRMS";
AB;Two views have come to dominate the debate on the globalization of innovation in the emerging knowledge-based economy. The first contends that globalization reduces the significance of the home base as the primary site for innovation, as firms increasingly source and apply their innovations on a global basis. The second view as articulated in the innovation systems approach contends that the institutionally embedded nature of the innovation process, which is a central feature of the new economy, demands a continued, and even accentuated, role for the local context. In this article, we seek to contribute to the debate by evaluating the extent to which the institutional context and local setting play an important role in determining the innovative behaviour of manufacturing firms in Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we compare the practices of 242 indigenous and multinational establishments with respect to in-house technological capabilities, innovative processes, external sources of innovative ideas, and the nature and the extent of innovative inter-firm practices. Our findings indicate that indigenous firms are more likely to perform innovative activities locally and are more embedded in the Ontario economy than their multinational counterparts, as they exhibit higher R&D intensity, have a larger proportion of scientific, technical and managerial employees, adopt innovative inter-firm practices more extensively, and are more likely to source innovative ideas from local customers. The multinational establishments, in contrast, tend to exhibit lower R&D intensity, are more reliant on their inhouse marketing units, and continue to rely on their parent companies as a primary source for innovative ideas. These results suggest that local context still exerts a significant influence on the nature and extent of innovative activities in the knowledge-based economy.;

First, a stylized account is given of some 'comparativist' approaches, mainly in international and comparative political economy and in economic sociology. The concepts of institution and institutional change are then examined under four headings: the origins and role of institutions in capitalism; institutional variety and change; the relations between national and transnational institutional orders; and the policy implications of institutional comparisons. The final section outlines an approach to institutional change based in 'historical political economy'.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"regulation theory; international regulation; environmental policy; state theory; societal relationship with nature; biodiversity";
AB;Global environmental politics is often seen as an area where cooperation among nation-states can be improved and common and trans-border issues can be regulated. The article criticizes this view which tends to ignore the complex crisis of the relationships between societies and ongoing economic competition among nation-states. Therefore, the difference between intentional political control and the unintended stabilization of social contradictions (regulation, in the usage of the French regulation school) is shown, and used to analyse the broader context of the regulation of societal relationships with nature. For an adequate understanding of such a network of international regulation, however, one must carefully analyse the transformation of the nation-state within the process of capitalist globalization and its role in this network which goes beyond environmental regimes. Global biodiversity politics is an interesting example of such a network: it can be seen that capital interests in the use of genetic resources for the 'life science industry' is a driving force in this area of contention. National regulations, in the sense of intentional politics, constitute a necessary aspect of the process of creating stable conditions for the commodification and valorization of genetic resources. At the same time, environmental politics becomes part of global capitalist competition and regional and national competition.;

AB;Globalization tendencies are transforming the nature and organization of business systems. This is particularly the case in the Asia-Pacific region where business systems are socially and institutionally embedded. In this article, I argue that the dialectical tendencies of globalization towards homogenization and differentiation have differential impacts on the configurations and dynamics of Asian business systems and their constituents. While these business systems tend to be relatively enduring over time because of their historical legacies and institutional embeddedness, major business firms emerging from these national business systems may be much more susceptible to changes brought about by globalization tendencies. This is because actors and elites in Asian economies are increasingly enrolled into global actor networks which in turn reshape how these Asian actors conceive and operate their business firms and/or political-economic networks. It is possible that globalization has only Limited effects on Asian business systems at the structural level but significant transformational impact on Asian business firms at the level of key actors. I show how the two-way enrolment of global actors into/from Asian business systems can contribute to significant transformations in the dominant forms and organization of these business systems.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"technological convergence; regulation; telecommunications; broadcasting; European commission";
ID;"CORPORATE ACTOR; POLICY-MAKING; UNION; STATE";
AB;This article looks at the European Union (EU) policy of technological 'convergence', concentrating on the convergence of telecommunications and broadcasting. The underlying theme is that regulatory agencies are political actors and their actions need to be analysed in the context of who benefits from the policy outcome. In addition, regulatory regimes are themselves variables in bureaucratic/institutional turf wars and in the political process.;
;The specific case discussed here of DG XIII of the European Commission responsible for telecommunications provides an example of attempts by a regulatory agency to broaden the scope of its regulatory reach. It shows how it utilized a theoretical reconstruction of markets to justify alterations both at EU and at national level in regulatory regimes that would have had direct consequences in benefiting its allied telecommunications and Internet operators and in disadvantaging public service broadcasters. The article discusses the ensuing reactions to this intervention. It concludes that DG XIII s attempts to redefine markets and regulatory regimes in its own interests and in the interests of its traditional industrial allies have not only been thwarted, but have strengthened the sectoral-based regulatory regime it wished to displace, and have also undermined its own credibility as a regulator.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;Three months after the debacle at Seattle, the 'leadership' of the WTO seems unable to come to grips with the several elements that led to the collapse. But one thing is reasonably certain: international economic negotiations in general, and multilateral trade negotiations in particular, can never be the same again after Seattle. Technically, 'mandated' negotiations in agriculture and services, and 'reviews' under other agreements have been launched, but these will at best mark time. Meanwhile, the members are engaged in so-called 'confidence-building' measures, including questions about internal transparency and decision making, to bridge differences and enable reconvening of the Ministerial Conference. But no one believes this is likely for at least a year, if not more. With the WTO's remit now extending beyond border trade measures in goods to areas and sectors of economic policy within countries' domestic jurisdiction, multilateral trade negotiations, and agreements involving harmonization of laws, regulations and standards within each country, become more and more complex. What may be successful for one country or group of countries may not be so in others. Until this reality is grasped by the rich and the powerful and attempts to frame and enforce one-size-fit-all trade rules and obligations applicable to all countries are given up, the WTO system faces an uncertain future in the longer term.;

First, a combination of selective liberalization with close government-bank-business relations contributed to the investment boom and excessive leveraging that made the Korean economy vulnerable to external shocks. Second, we examine how politically generated uncertainty in an election year, compounded by features of the party system, resulted in a delayed response to problems in the financial sector and in dealing with the IMF. These delays, in turn, contributed to the length and depth of the crisis.;

TI;Japanese policy and the East Asian currency crisis: abject defeat or quiet victory?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DE;"Japan; East Asia; China; currency crisis; developmental state; New Miyazawa Initiative";
ID;MYTH;
AB;Japan stands accused of purveying a defective developmental state model of growth to the East Asian states which was responsible for the onset of the currency crises from 1997 onwards, and then of failing to provide the necessary leadership for the stabilization and recovery of the region. Japan's position of economic dominance and its nascent political leadership role in East Asia are now seen to be under attack. However, this article argues that over the longer term Japan is continuing to exercise considerable covert economic and political leadership in the region. Examination of Japanese policy makers' perceptions of the East Asian crisis reveals that they see the region as hit above all by currency crises which have transmuted into economic ones, but that the model of export and DFI-powered growth in the region is still fundamentally sound. Japanese policy makers contend that Japan is not responsible for the occurrence of the crises, nor are the USA- and IMF-prescribed solutions likely to hold the key to the restoration of growth in East Asia. Instead, they quietly lay the blame for the crises upon China for undercutting the competitiveness of East Asian exports and moving ahead of the ASEAN-4 in the regional production cycle. Hence, Japanese policy, as manifested in the New Miyazawa Initiative, has concentrated upon regearing existing developmental models, and has gradually begun to restore a measure of confidence in Japanese economic leadership and to set the agendas of both the USA and multilateral institutions towards the crises.;

ID;LABOR;
AB;The combined restructuring-commodity chain approach is applied to shed light on processes that explain changes in the spatial and functional division of labour in the dyestuff and tanning industries. Both industries are pollution-intensive and are experiencing a locational shift from the north to the south and increasingly widespread sourcing. A distinction is made between producer-driven and buyer-driven commodity chains. This helps to highlight differences in technological characteristics and explain relationships between the different nodes in a chain. Price competition may take place in both types of chains, and the strong focus on price competition in both industries is a key factor in explaining their environmental practice. The findings suggest, however, that it may be easier to advance beyond strong price competition in the producer-driven dyestuff chain.;

DE;"Germany; Mexico; financial policy; competitiveness; banking; monetary policy";
AB;This articles employs a game-theoretic framework to analyze the behavior of economic agents and policy makers within true types of bank-led financial market systems. The game predicts the effects of bank-led finance on financial policy making in Germany and Mexico, which are substantially borne out by the empirical analysis. The evidence suggests that Mexican policy makers have tended to adopt short-term-oriented external monetary policies which have tolerated extreme overvaluation, whereas German policy makers have tended to favor competitiveness-conscious stability-oriented external monetary policies because of: (1) weak competition among Mexican banks as compared with German banks, and (2) Mexican policy makers' traditional lack of credibility as compared with their German counterparts.;

ID;GOVERNMENT;
AB;Over the last century there has been a fundamental change in the economic orientation of industrially advanced democracies, and this has had a pervasive impact on both their macroeconomies and their international economic relations. Put more starkly, changing expectations about prosperity and the role of government as an economic guardian have fundamentally reshaped the structure of the world economy. In humorous tone, it might even be called a cowardly new world, one in which societies refuse to brave the vagaries of unrestrained markets. This argument presents an alternative to traditional explanations of economic processes and relations in which scholars have studied changes very narrowly and have conceived of them as independent from one another. This article looks at these processes and relations as comprising 'economic plates': i.e. phenomena that are fundamentally linked so that they can be influenced in tote. Macroeconomic processes and international economic relations do occupy the same fundamental plate, and the plate has made significant shifts over the past century as a result of strong underlying forces in the form of changing orientations regarding people's economic fates and governments' relation to the market.;

ID;"HISTORY; STATE";
AB;As a field of study, international political economy suffers from a significant historical deficit. Where this deficit is recognized, it is most commonly addressed by adding 'historical context' to the inquiry, as in the injunction to place globalization into its proper historical context. While this is a useful and necessary first step, it does not adequately address the problem of 'historicizing' IPE. In order to genuinely historicize IPE, we must first acknowledge the element of reflection which infuses each level of social inquiry, from how the object of investigation is framed and explored to how agency is considered in relation to particular issues. This means going beyond context and actors to ask what constitutes the form of knowledge appropriate to uncovering and remaking the social world. Historicizing IPE, in other words, demands that we interrogate our aims and purposes as openly as we explore the subject under study.;

AB;"Numerous studies have recently emerged on the impact of economic globalization for the nation-state. Philip G. Cerny to date is one of the few scholars to generate hypotheses about the state's future role in providing various public goods. He principally asserts that globalization forces state governments to continually adjust their political institutions to this process. In his terminology, the optimal 'political economies of scale' are changing, leading to a shift from the welfare state to the 'competition state'. While he depicts this development as practically inevitable, the theoretical foundation for this claim remains unclear; consequently, the hypotheses based on ire are largely left ambiguous. I propose that the analytical scope of Cerny's model can be extended by employing insights from the economic subdiscipline of fiscal federalism, which is concerned about the assignment of public sector functions among different levels of government. The article develops three hypotheses on this basis, which are tested in a probability probe by examining the rationale underlying the development of European integration from the inception of the Single European Market (SEM) to the Maastricht Treaty. The argumentation suggests that the supranationalization of monetary policy as well as the subsequent budgetary increase in EU structural funds have been logical results of the preceding deregulation, associated with the SEM.";

ID;BYELARUS;
AB;After 1991 some of the former Soviet republics directed their international trade primarily to Russia and other former members of the Soviet state, while others shifted their trade policies sharply away h-om this pattern and toward new partners. A central reason for the difference in trade policy orientations, not sufficiently appreciated by available literature, is substantial variations in the strength of the new republics' national identities. The influence of national identity on policy outcomes is mediated by an important intervening variable: domestic structures and coalition-building processes. Adding consideration of domestic structures makes it possible to trace the process and get closer to identifying the exact agency through which the national identity norm gets transmitted into state commercial policies. A focused comparison of Latvia and Belarus suggests the significance of this national identity explanation relative to likely rivals, such as market competitiveness and security concerns. Thus this study adds support to the Weberian insight that cultural, idea-based influences should be treated as significant in their own right and not merely as residuals subordinated to interest-based thinking.;

ID;"NATIONAL POLICY AUTONOMY; ABDICATION; LABOR";
AB;In Partisan Politics in the Global Economy (1998), Geoffrey Garrett provides arguably the most important intervention to date in the debater on the continued viability of social democratic corporatism in the context of globalization. His book is intended to offer some comfort to beleaguered social democrats while resuscitating arguments that partisan politics continues to matter in an era characterized by heightened capital mobility. In this article I take issue with Garrett's argument, suggesting that far from reviving social democratic optimism, Partisan Politics in fact only marginally modifies the narrow economistic logic of more orthodox 'globaloney'. Where the conventional mythology of globalization summons an inexorable neoliberalizing logic of inevitable convergence, Garrett supplants a bifurcated logic of institutionally mediated convergence. Whereas social democratic corporatism is 'selected for' in nations characterized by social democratic corporatist institutions and traditions, neoliberalism. is 'selected for' in the absence of such cultural and institutional specificities. I challenge this revised logic of inevitability, arguing that if any residual social democratic optimism is to be revived, globalization's perceived logic of inevitability must first be exposed for the myth that ft is.;

DE;"capital mobility; exchange rates; fiscal policy; globalization";
AB;The central claim of Partisan Politics in the Global Economy is that social democracy continues to be both distinctive and successful in the global economy in cases where powerful left-of-center parties are allied with strong and centralized trade union movements. Hay asks whether this means that countries without entrenched corporatist institutions must give in to global market forces by shrinking state activism. The first part of this article demonstrates that there is scant evidence that the international integration of financial markets has been associated with a reduction in fiscal activism in the OECD. This is consistent with my partisan mediation thesis. Here, however, I wish to take up Hay's challenge of analyzing policy developments without recourse to my institutional typology. The second part of the article shows that fiscal policy in the OECD has been considerably more restrictive where governments have committed to fixed exchange rates. I argue that European countries have nonetheless chosen to fix their exchange rates as part of the broader regional integration project. The final part of the article suggests that the eurozone may well not be dominated by conservative fiscal policies. The European Central Bank is unlikely to be as conservative as the Bundesbank and the political and economic incentives for fiscal prudence in the eurozone are weaker than under the EMS.;

ID;IMF;
AB;"A significant adaptation has recently occurred in the mandate of the International Monetary Fund. With no alteration to its legal charter, the Fund has effectively become the promoter of a putative consensus among its leading member states on intrusive norms of industrial regulation. At a time when much attention was focused on the need for new tools of global economic governance, such a shift in the role of an organization viewed as emblematic of the post-World War II order potentially had wide implications. Skeptics began to ask whether intergovernmental organizations originally designed to encourage mutually beneficial collaboration among sovereign member states were simply turning into crude instruments for advancing the interests of the strong. This article disputes the historical uniqueness of the turn underway inside post-war international economic organizations; it draws parallels to the work of the League of Nations in the interwar period and to inconclusive multilateral negotiations in the 1940s. Those parallels suggest the weakness of claims that a true consensus now exists among dominant states on basic issues of industrial governance, and cast doubt on the wisdom of rapidly extending established organizational mandates.";

ID;"UNITED-STATES; UNION";
AB;The article contradicts the thesis of Mancur Olson on the relation between interest associations and economic growth, presented in his book The Rise and Decline of Nations. It is based on empirical evidence from studies on interest associations and on sectoral corporatism. First, contrary to Olson's assumptions, the number of associations has not increased over time. Instead, mergers have reduced their numbers. Nor did war break up 'distributional coalitions' but strengthened them and made them more comprehensive. Second, contrary to Olson's view, more associations do not mean they have more political influence, hence greater bias in public policy. Third, interest associations are not necessarily detrimental to economic performance and growth. By contrast, we provide evidence that interest associations can make a positive contribution to economic performance. This undermines the overall argument that political stability produces more particularistic interest associations and increases institutional sclerosis, thus diminishing economic performance and growth.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"migration; regionalism; neoliberalism; Americas; restructuring; NAFTA";
AB;The coordination of migration policies is generally understood as a mechanism for improving the management of migration flows in response to new migration challenges or to pressures by public opinion in receiving countries. The analysis of the Regional Conference on Migration offers another interpretation. Such coordination among countries of North and Central America is not so much about controlling flows. Rather, one can look at this process of coordination as a mechanism through which specific patterns of social and spatial relations are being locked into the region. The coordination of migration policies in the RCM constitutes an effort to manage the mobility of capital and labour in an orderly manner. In addition, the coordinating effort serves two other purposes: to attribute specific responsibilities to states, and to depoliticize the issue of migration. Such developments fit neatly with the neoliberal project of integration, with the imposition of particular state-society relations onto the various countries involved.;

DE;"common markets; nation-state; transnational regulations; implementation; European Union; role of institutions";
ID;"EUROPEAN-COMMUNITY; COURT";
AB;The polarized debate on the future of the nation-state in common markets singularly focuses on who controls supra national decision making. Scholars of the European Union, for instance, have for long disagreed over the extent to which nation-states control the European Commission. We believe that common markets can erode the authority of the nation-state through a second venue: with the promulgation of rules that, upon proper implementation, reach deep into national legislative and administrative authority and strip the nation-state of its ability to regulate important aspects of social Life. When viewed from this perspective, the nation-state appears strangely positioned. In the European Union and Mercosur states at times yield to and at times refuse transnational rules. We propose an explanation for these implementation patterns. The explanation will, in our view, contribute more to a genuine understanding of current state-market conditions than any additional claim for or against the hegemony of common markets. Our hypothesis is institutional, centring on the challenges that transnational rules pose on the policy legacies and interest group organization of nation-states. To test our views, we turn to the European Union and the fate of a major environmental directive in Italy, Great Britain and Spain.;

ID;FOREIGN-INVESTMENT;
AB;Russian economic reformers of the early 1990s believed that integration with the global economy would facilitate the construction of a market economy and the reconstruction of the Russian state by helping to break down economic interests inherited from the USSR. However, the global economy did not act as an agent of transformation in Russia. Russia's reintegration with the global economy became narrowly focused on the sale of treasury bills to finance the budget deficit as attempts to stabilize state finances in 1996-7 made Russian financial markets attractive to foreign investors. There was, however, no underlying change in the government's economic fortunes and attempts at stabilizing state finances engendered political conflict. As a result, Russia was exposed to changes in world markets and the rouble collapsed in August 1998. The devastation of the Russian economy as a consequence of these developments means that the Russian state is the only force that can lead reform. However, it is in such a weak position that its ability to act as an agent of change is doubtful.;

AB;The processes of globalization and trade regionalization are creating new forms of regional concentration of economic activities both within and across sovereign borders. The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement has spawned cross-border strategic production alliances that impact economic development at both the subnational and transnational levels. This article examines the southern California/Mexico transnational apparel production network: NAFTA-era bi-national production alliances that are reconfiguring strategic apparel production districts, as well. as the larger North American apparel commodity chain.;
;"Using the commodity chains framework, I analyze the importance of NAFTA as an intervening variable in the economic integration of North America's textile/apparel sector; the extent to which southern California apparel production has shifted offshore to Mexico; and the characteristics of post-NAFTA strategic production alliances. From this discussion I address more fundamental issues of economic development, namely how cross-border changes in the mix of high- and low-value production activities have reconfigured the southern California fashion and apparel production center, and garment-specific industrial clusters in Mexico, and enhanced the prospects for industrial upgrading in Mexico.";

ID;"MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY; FLEXIBLE SPECIALIZATION; LABOR";
AB;This article explores the impact of Hollywood's increasingly prominent role in the financing and development of digital technology on the resurgence and restructuring of American hegemony. It argues that the true relevance of the alliance between Hollywood and the US military-industrial complex, and of the overall technological convergence among sectors as disparate as film, broadcasting, software and telecommunications, cannot be grasped without looking at the broader context of 'privatization of authority' and consolidation of merchant power in the world economy. The emergence of Siliwood - the hybrid sector that weds Hollywood and Silicon Valley - shifts debates about US economic and military dominance onto the issues of culture, play and entertainment, and continues to obscure - both discursively and spatially - the distinctions between public and private, politics and economics, work and leisure that have long been regarded as the precondition of bourgeois hegemony. By blurring these boundaries, allowing for the emergence of new hegemonic blocs, and constructing new spatial 'comfort zones', the American entertainment industry has successfully managed to reinvigorate and reinscribe US hegemony at the end of this very American century.;

AB;This article argues that, with very few exceptions, social theory has neglected the usefulness of concepts derived from 'the economy of morals' approach as theorized by Albert O. Hirschman. In an attempt to popularize Hirschman's unique critique of political economy, it: is treated here as a middle-range theory that dissents from the two extremes of grand theory and factual empirical evidence, and thus provides social scientists with concepts that, rather than offering an alternative between either 'deducing down' or 'building up', both 'deduce down' and 'build up' at the same time. After the events of '1989', social science and social theory have barely begun to reflect on the impact that these events had on a theoretical level. it is argued that Hirschman's approach differs from most current sociological reasoning in that it can be used to explain unforeseen circumstances and unexpected events. Hirschman's conceptualization of 'the economy of morals' thus provides a new theoretical framework that has the potential to overcome most of current social theory's weaknesses in conceptualizing the 'post-1989' world.;

AB;Despite the unprecedented nature of the transitions in Eastern Europe since 1989, scholars of international political economy have done little to analyse the processes of globalization and social transformation that they represent. Post-socialist countries provide rich sites for advancing our knowledge of the global market process and its social and political impacts. This article focuses on the gender aspects of globalization. It argues that the marketing of gender distinctions in globalized culture industries and consumer advertising has had indelible effects on capitalist market expansion in Eastern. Europe. Reinscribing gender identities and desires is a sound multinational corporate strategy for maximizing profits and increasing consumption in this region. But the interplay between the local and the global is not straightforward. A case study of the Czech Republic, in particular of Czech Harlequin and Cosmopolitan magazine, shows how this global marketing is contested in the post-socialist context. In the aftermath of communism, new norms of gender relations, ostensibly exports from the west enable the extension of markets and commodification, while also empowering women as individuals and consumers.;

ID;ECONOMY;
AB;This article analyses the Asian miracle both as an ideological construct and as an empirical experience. As an ideological construct, the Asian miracle can best be understood in the context of the western construction of Otherness. Such a construction is an expression of a complex web of power relations forged mainly by a struggle between east and west over industrial achievement, the meaning of industrial progress and governance.;
;As an empirical experience, industrialization in East Asia may be apprehended through gender as a key organizing principle manifested in a four-tier system of industrial work. Industrial strategies in East Asia have been deployed in conjunction with reproductive strategies which correspond to the specificities of capital formation and degree of capital-technology intensity. The emerging social patterns since the crisis began in 1997 indicate that gradual changes which have taken place in the political economy of women's labour in East Asia have not necessarily altered a gender order governed by cultural conservatism which privileges males over females. A female gaze on the relation between economy and polity may contribute to the redesign of development policy along norms and values that can promote more gender-balanced and humane societies.;

AB;Despite a rapidly expanding literature in the last decade, the question of migration remains a neglected area of research in IPE, global political economy and political geography. In addressing this deficiency, this article seeks to contribute to the growing debate over the links between 'globalization', IPE and the geopolitical economy of migration. Rather than the more 'traditional' focus of LPE, I attempt to integrate different political-economic scales of analysis (from the regional to the international). Drawing upon an analysis of North African (Maghrebin) migrant workers in the Paris automobile industry, I argue that, first, globalization needs to be placed in historical context in terms of the international/global political economy of migration. Second, I maintain the need to understand migration as a strategic issue within international political economy. Third, I argue that the national state is still relevant as a geopolitical economic 'lens' on the contemporary globalization of migration. And fourth, I suggest the presence of what I call a 'spatial vent'. This describes the forced and/or encouraged repatriation of migrant workers to partially diffuse threats to accumulation and legitimation generated by reconciling economic imperatives (industrial and labour market restructuring) with the political, social and cultural priorities of the French state (French 'republicanism' and 'universalism'). The 'spatial vent' is considered to be one means of grasping the territoriality of capitalism.;

AB;"The creation of closed-end country funds has been an important step in extending the globalization of finance to developing regions. This article examines three instances of closed-end fund creation and argues that international financial institutions (IFIs) have been necessary for the evolution of the closed-end funds industry in Africa. IFIs provide a certain amount of investment moneys; they reduce transaction costs, provide information and promote products that allow states, firms and investors to benefit. Eventually, if IFIs can demonstrate the benefits of investment, the networks they foster can make other private capital market activities exclusive of a particular IFI possible. The article specifically considers the International Finance Corporation and the Commonwealth Development Corporation and compares these examples with one where an IFI was not involved Morgan Stanley's Africa Investment Fund. Taken together, the examples conceptualize IFIs as go-betweens among state and non-state actors which can facilitate solutions to economic and political market failure in the contemporary era of global governance.";

AB;"The Eurodollar market, which was established in the City of London in the 1950s, can be considered the progenitor of the global financial system which exists today, for it marked the beginning of a movement away from the restrictions placed by the Bretton Woods system on international capital movements, and a return to the liberal internationalism and laissez-faire order of the private and central bankers that ended with the collapse of the gold standard in 1931. Explanations as to why this development should have taken place in London rely, for the most part, on two contending theses: (1) that it was the direct consequence of the market mechanism inevitably overcoming official obstruction, or 'friction'; (2) that deliberate state action created the conditions which allowed the market to evolve and operate. Adherents of the former claim that the Eurodollar was the innovation of the City's merchant and overseas bankers, looking to finance the rapid increase in international trade that took place at the end of the 1950s, in a world still constrained by the restrictions imposed as a consequence of placing the international economy on a war footing in 1939. Adherents of the latter claim that it was a direct consequence of deliberate action taken by the British state to re-establish the City of London as the world's foremost international financial. centre. This article, which is based on archival evidence and interviews with state and private sector figures involved in the development of the Euromarkets, argues that the City's position at the centre of the Eurocurrency system was a direct consequence of it having evolved within an institutional framework established over 100 years earlier. This seeks to challenge simple state/market dichotomies and suggests that the origins of the Euromarkets can be better understood with reference to the 'governance of regulatory space' - whether by states, markets or various associational forms. Only by examining the historical occupation of 'regulatory space' can we have a more realistic view of how financial innovation evolves.";

ID;"PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PERFORMANCE; LABOR";
AB;"This article proposes a classification of capitalist forms on the basis of two concepts, 'property rights regimes' (PRRs) and 'accumulation governance structures' (AGSs). The former defines the way in which the ownership of wealth and surplus value is distributed, the latter the institutional systems governing the uses of surplus value to sustain accumulation. Three PRRs - 'concentrated private property', 'diffused private property' and 'state property' - and four AGSs - 'goods markets', 'companies markets', 'external hierarchies' and 'internal hierarchies' - are defined. Various historical forms of capitalism are described as resulting from particular combinations of PRRs and AGSs. Then a few ideal types are outlined: 'classical capitalism', 'market-oriented corporate capitalism' and 'bank-oriented corporate capitalism'. Finally a hypothesis is advanced as to how capitalism evolves, namely that historical transformations of PRRs and AGSs tend to pave the way for the emergence of 'autonomous capital': accumulation is controlled through complex systems of external hierarchies among firms; the large concerns which are in command of these hierarchical structures are collectively self-owned and formally controlled by their managers through strategic cross-shareholding; no external shareholder exerts effective control.";

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"globalization; democratic theory; hegemony; market ideology; 'good sense'; 'double movement'";
AB;This article argues that the most fundamental challenge of globalization (both as a concept and as a sociopolitical process) lies in our need to reassess its bearing on the meaning and potential of democratic praxis. My purpose then is first to offer a critique of neoliberal globalization from the vantage point of democratic theory, exposing how this form of market ideology is inherently antithetical to democratic principles. The second part of the article shows how two central themes in the thought of Antonio Gramsci and Karl Polanyi may be usefully combined to produce a forceful counter-hegemonic model to contest the depoliticization, atomization and commodification endemic to neoliberal globalization. Whereas Polanyi demonstrated the repercussions of such domination in the economic lives of people, Gramsci was concerned to show the political domination that necessarily precipitated it. I argue that Polanyi's critique of the self-regulating market: and his discernment of society's 'double movement', when bridged to Gramsci's theory of ideological hegemony and his notion of 'good sense', supply vital components of a critical theorization of globalization as well as practical strategies of resistance to the anti-politics of market ideology. Ultimately, I submit that this critical integration of Polanyi and Gramsci into the globalization debates produces a much needed analytic strategy which maintains a primacy on political agency, critically specifies the national-international distinction, and makes a methodological virtue of radical democratic theory.;

AB;Boundaries between major actors in the international system are less like lines in the sand than like frontiers encompassing broad areas of geographic and metaphoric overlap. Boundary locations are relative, variable and often contested, reflecting the contingency of claims by representatives of states and other corporate entities, in this case multinational firms, regarding the appropriate reach of each body's interests and the legal and practical limits to each one's authority. These propositions are tested by examining the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a multinational firm composed of multiple domestic and foreign affiliates, during the period of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Joint interests attenuated formal boundaries separating Kuwait from countries hosting its direct foreign investments, and sers ed as primary motivations for external intervention. Boundary transgressions are effected by persons with multiple identities and roles who occupy positions of authority, not only in that these persons command strategic and economic resources, but also insofar as they are skilled manipulators of symbolic tokens of identity and expertise.;

AB;Notions of the 'internationalization of the state' in neo-Gramscian writings are vague, ambiguous and lack empirical grounding. Here it is argued that the 'internationalization of the state' can only be understood through a focus on the social basis of the state. A case study of the UK reveals that HM Treasury and the Bank of England have been penetrated by transnational eco:nomic interests and that they subsequently act on behalf of these interests. In this respect the current prevailing global discourse or 'Washington consensus' of sound money and open markets is primarily generated, sustained and reinforced by 'internationalized' or 'transnationalized' state agencies such as HM Treasury or the Bank of England, which act on behalf of internationally mobile forms of capital. There is, however, a complex, mutually reinforcing relationship between the prevailing 'Washington consensus' and the policies and practice of these national state agencies.;

AB;"The process of globalization seems to undermine the nation-state as well as liberal democracy. In consequence, the need to establish democratic structures on an international level is widely postulated. The argument presented here is that discussions on the alleged loss of the nation-state's sovereignty are characterized by several theoretical deficiencies. First, they employ a limited concept/definition of the state; then they are based on a limited understanding of the relations of capitalist globalization and political regulation; above all, they use a concept of democracy that is rather foreshortened and instrumentalizing. However, in order to gain sufficient understanding of the chances for international democracy and of the role of NGOs within the framework of an 'international civil society', it is necessary to recognize the fact that the nation-state continues to be a precondition of globalization, though with a modified role. That is, the 'antagonism of the bourgeois constitution' (Marx) is renewing itself in a different mode.";

DE;"globalization; world city; global city; governance of complexity; local state; urban politics";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; URBAN REGIMES";
AB;This article discusses perspectives of local agency in the age of the world city. It presents a brief critique of the debate on globalization and posits that globalization makes states. This includes a discussion of the local state as a complex creature of state and civil society, of the regulatory power of the urban and of the world city as a site of the emergence of the post-national state. While it can be argued that globalization hollows out the state and helps facilitate the replacement of state by non-state institutions in the market or civil society, it also creates new forms of states. The state does not wither away but is rather reincarnated in a plethora of forms on many socio-spatial scales. Globalization makes states but these differ from the ones we used to know. This article concentrates on those new forms of governance that occur on the urban level, particularly in so-called world or global cities. It makes the case for the recognition of the urban as a relevant site of the political in the era of globalization. Politics in world cities is concerned with the governance of complexity which can be understood best through a combination of regime theory, regulation theory and discourse theory.;

ID;"NATION-STATE; THIRD-WORLD; GLOBALIZATION; POSTCOLONIALISM; CAPITALISM; DISCOURSE; POLITICS; CULTURE; POVERTY; POWER";
AB;As debates on globalization spread across a broad range of analytical domains, the way the meanings associated with the global, the local and the transnational are interpreted is itself increasingly becoming a site of contention. It is a question not only of how we theoretically approach issues associated with global politics and cultural change, but also of who are the subjects of knowledge in such theorizations, and how do a variety of historical and geopolitical contextualizations influence the ideas, concepts and thematic priorities developed by those same subjects or agents of knowledge. This article argues that many of the theories of globalization produced in the west need to be rethought in the light of critical post-colonial perspectives. This entails not only a more pronounced emphasis on the past and present of projects of western power, but also a more sustained treatment of critical research on globalization produced in the non-west. By making a connection between the global and the postcolonial, the article seeks to open up different ways of thinking about politics and culture in global times.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"global warming; climate change; fossil fuel industries; state theory; structural power";
AB;This article challenges accounts of global environmental politics which come from a liberal institutionalist position and focus on the development of international regimes. We argue that a perspective which starts from the role of the state in promoting capital accumulation can much better explain the content both of state policies and of particular international agreements. We first outline the way that fossil fuel companies have been able to secure their interests in state policies on global warming. We then develop the argument that their ability to do this is best explained in terms of the structural power of capital, deriving from the role of the state within capitalist societies. Finally, we suggest that this may also be producing transformations within global warming politics, as insurance companies in particular become involved. Such involvement, particularly given the heightened power of finance under conditions of globalization, suggests the possibility of constructing coalitions which may turn the constraints which the structural power of capital has produced to date into opportunities to promote attempts to deal with global warming.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"internationalization; business systems; multinationals; societal institutions";
ID;GLOBALIZATION;
AB;The increasing internationalization of economic activities in the late twentieth century has encouraged the belief that a new form of cross-national economic organization is becoming established and replacing existing forms of capitalism. Both the intensification of international competition and growth of managerial coordination across borders are seen as generating the convergence of currently separate business systems. However, the extent of such internationalization is less than often claimed, especially when compared to the late nineteenth century, and the processes by which it will lead to such convergence remain obscure. Since the different varieties of capitalist economic organization in Europe, Asia and the Americas developed over some time interdependently with dominant societal institutions, the ways in which they change as a result of internationalization are path dependent and reflect their historical legacies as well as current institutional linkages. Qualitative changes in central business system characteristics, such as ownership relations, non-ownership coordination and employment policies, are therefore unlikely to be rapid or to result solely from internationalization. Furthermore, the ways in which firms from different business systems internationalize reflect their varied natures and strategies which are unlikely to alter greatly unless key institutions alter. If multinational firms do develop different characteristics from national competitors, their impact on their domestic and host business systems will likewise depend on a number of strong conditions. Similarly, the establishment of a distinctive and dominant 'global' business system is only likely in very restrictive circumstances.;

DE;"governance; economic coordination; globalization; social system of; production; nestedness; path dependency";
ID;ORGANIZATION;
AB;This article argues that the coordination of economic institutions is occurring simultaneously at various spatial levels (e.g. subnational region, nation-state, transnational region, global). The institutional arrangements which at one time were congruent at the national levels are now more dispersed at multiple spatial levels. Impressive economic performance now requires that economic actors be well coordinated in all spatial areas simultaneously. In short, actors are increasingly nested in institutional arrangements which are linked at all levels. The parts of each system have become far more interdependent than was the case only two decades ago, and the increasingly complex distribution of power and resources across geographical levels is further evidence of how economic institutions have become nested in multiple worlds. This perspective about the diffusion of power suggests that there is slowly evolving a set of institutions for the governance of societies at multiple levels, but this process is poorly understood and its long-term consequences are rarely discussed.;
;The future is very much open, but a perspective on long-term historical trends suggests that one of the major challenges ol: our time is to create a new theory of governance involving institutions and local territories nested in a world of unprecedented complexity, one in which subnational regions, nation-states, continental and global regimes are all intricately linked.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DT;Article;
DE;"sovereign states; Asante; imperialism; new institutionalist economics";
ID;"ASANTE; POLITICS; TRADE";
AB;This article examines the economics of institutions approach which purports to explain the rise of sovereign territorial states as the prevalent unit in the international system, according to this institutional analysis, sovereign territorial states emerged as the dominant unit because they were more efficient than other political arrangements in the international system. This argument frames the failure of most non-western policies to become sovereign territorial states by the beginning of the twentieth century as an instance in which institutional structures were effective neither at meeting individuals' goals, nor at resolving collective action dilemmas, particularly with regard to security and economic exchange. Applying that argument to a nineteenth-century African kingdom, I find that the factors which explain the assigning of colonial, not sovereign, status to that kingdom are of a traditional economic origin, with cultural biases and relative military capability coming into play when economic competition tightened.;

AB;Processes of globalization involve changes in the spatialities of power and social relations. This article develops a theory of regulatory landscapes, as a conceptual tool to aid our understanding of processes of globalization.;
;"Regulatory landscapes vary along two dimensions, both of which relate to scale and boundaries and extend from 'bounded' to 'trans-boundary': first, the degree of boundedness of economic accumulation; and second, the degree of boundedness of political regulation. Processes of gee-regulatory change, then, may be conceived in terms of two analytically separable moments. The first moment of gee-regulatory change is the trans-boundary extension of economic accumulation. The second moment, which is the focus of this article, is the trans-boundary or extra-territorial extension of political regulation. It is hypothesized that the attempted trans-boundary extension of political regulation - to avoid regulatory underprovision - leads to border skirmishes, battles or negotiations about the nature of boundaries.";
;These processes of gee-regulatory change are examined through the lens of offshore financial development in the Bahamas and Cayman. Two geolegal cases or border skirmishes - the Castle Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia cases - are investigated ethnographically to reveal the changing meanings attached to borders during processes of gee-regulatory change.;
;In conclusion a general model of gee-regulatory change is presented in which border skirmishes, negotiations about the allocation of power and authority or the shape of the regulatory landscape, play a central role.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"capital; power; technology; institutional economics; Veblen; Mumford";
AB;Existing theories of capital, neo-classical as well as Marxist, are anchored in the material sphere of production and consumption. This article offers a new analytical framework for capital as a crystallization of power. The relative nature of power requires accumulation to be measured in differential, not absolute, terms. For absentee owners, the main goal is not to maximize profits, but rather to 'beat the average' and exceed the 'normal rate of return'. The theoretical framework builds on Thorstein Veblen's separation of industry from business and on Lewis Mumford's dichotomy between democratic and authoritarian techniques. Extending their contributions, we argue that capital is a business, not an industrial category, a human mega-machine rather than a material artefact. Indeed, it is the social essence of capital which makes accumulation possible in the first place. Capital measures the present value of future business earnings, and these depend not on the productivity of industry as such, but on the ability of absentee owners strategically to limit such productivity to their own differential ends. Introducing the twin concepts of the 'differential power of capital' (DPK) and the rate of 'differential accumulation' (DA), we examine the non-linear and possibly negative link between industrial growth and accumulation in the USA.;

DE;"political culture; political economy; free trade; ideology; interest; British liberalism; radicalism";
ID;"GREAT-BRITAIN; POLICY; ORDER; STATE";
AB;This article explores the significance of ideas, values and collective representations in shaping political economy by examining the case of free trade in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain. Its aim is to tie a historical perspective on the importance of political culture to the current methodological debate about political economy in the social sciences. The opening critique of sectoral approaches is used to move the focus from material interests and economistic method to cultural significance and the interpretative framework underlying free trade. Shifting the attention to the knowledge of historical actors themselves reveals the formative role of ideology, historical memory and political language in constructing free trade as a collective good. Free trade was associated with a historical vision of national identity and societal self-development, and a moral ideal of the consumer, rather than with free market capitalism. The discussion concludes with some general thoughts on the importance of giving greater attention to political culture in the study of political economy.;

ID;"CIVIL-SOCIETY; LIMITS; STATE; ORGANIZATION; HEGEMONY; CRITIQUE; POLITICS";
AB;The author reviews the theoretical history of the international regime concert and its deployment within neorealist, neoliberal and institutionalist IR conceptual frameworks. He argues that the five criticisms or 'dragons' levelled by Susan Strange at the concept in her 1982 article 'Cave! Hic dragones' simultaneously underestimated the concept's theoretical originality and exaggerated the degree to which it committed theorists to a static, ordered and statist conception of the global political economy. The author shows how the concept, stripped of its neorealist and neoliberal heritage, can be deployed within a critical, neo-Gramscian theoretical framework to analyse meso-level structures and the role that global civil society actors are playing in contesting the normative structures (rights and rules), procedures and compliance mechanisms of existing and prospective international regimes.;

ID;"POLITICS; POWER";
AB;"With the current concern to critique neorealism, international relations (IR) theorists are looking to a variety of new perspectives as a way forward. Various authors have taken a specific interest in Weberian historical sociology (WHS), outlined in the works of Michael Mann and others. Nevertheless, there is currently only a rudimentary understanding of the approach within IR, and perhaps even less understanding of how it can be applied to LR. There is also a growing perception that the approach is inherently realist. This article seeks to redress this. It begins by laying out the basic WHS approach by identifying six general principles or traits. Special emphasis is given to recent developments in WHS's theory of state autonomy, which takes the approach beyond neorealism. Having considered how this approach overlaps with the concerns of various IR theorists, notably Linklater, Halliday and others, it proceeds to examine how the approach can take IR beyond neorealism, by applying it to understanding: international economic change through a historical examination of tariff protectionism and free trade; the international politics of states, war and revolution; and international systems change (namely European industrialization). It concludes with a possible historical sociology research agenda for the study of IR.";

AB;"This article examines the changing relationship between global cities and territorial states in contemporary Europe, and outlines some of its implications for the geography of world capitalism in the late twentieth century. Most accounts of global cities are based upon a 'zero-sum' conception of spatial scale that leads to an emphasis on the declining power of the territorial state: as the global scale expands, the state scale is said to contract. By contrast, I view globalization as a highly contradictory reconfiguration of superimposed spatial scales, including those on which the territorial state is organized. The state scale is not being eroded, but rearticulated and reterritorialized in relation to both sub-and supra-state scales. The resultant, re-scaled configuration of state territorial organization is provisionally labeled a 'glocal' state. As nodes of accumulation, global cities are sites of post-Fordist forms of global industrialization; as coordinates of state territorial power, global cities are local-regional levels within a larger, reterritorialized matrix of increasingly 'glocalized' state institutions. State re-scaling is a major accumulation strategy through which these transformed 'glocal' territorial states attempt to promote the global competitive advantage of their major urban regions. Global city formation and state re-scaling are therefore dialectically intertwined moments of a single dynamic of global capitalist restructuring. These arguments are illustrated through a discussion of the interface between global cities and territorial states in contemporary Europe, A concluding section argues that new theories and representations of spatial scale and its social production are needed to grasp the rapidly changing political geography of late twentieth-century capitalism.";

AB;This article presents the argument that governments can mitigate the political risks associated with significant liberalization of trade by suggesting that under certain conditions, rent-seeking opponents of trade liberalization may actually turn into critically important allies of governments attempting major policy shifts from protectionism to free trade. It argues that where domestic rent seekers are persuaded that the government cannot or will not provide sufficient rents, they may pursue a second-most-preferred strategy that entails attempting to secure access to cheaper factor inputs and access to foreign markets by actively supporting trade liberalization.;

ID;"LESS DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; MILITARY EXPENDITURES; UNITED-STATES; DEFENSE; GROWTH; INEQUALITY; POWER; PERFORMANCE; AMERICA; SYSTEM";
AB;In contemporary International Relations theory, there exists a sharp distinction between international political economy and security studies. However, this is largely a false distinction, a product of peculiar circumstances associated with the cold war, and one which is becoming increasingly anachronistic in the post-cold war era. In order to understand international relations in this era, a reintegration of the discipline is necessary.;
;This article considers three sets of issue areas in which appeals to themes normally associated with political economy are necessary to understand national security concerns. It explains how the cold war temporarily allowed the salience of these issues to recede, and why they are likely to be of increasing importance in contemporary international politics. It concludes with a brief survey of how these influences are likely to affect the national security of a variety of states in the coming years.;

AB;Despite their increasing prominence within the contemporary financial system, the collective impact of institutional investors (i.e. mutual, pension and hedge funds) and, in particular, their role in the reproduction of neoliberalism has received little attention among scholars. The argument of this article is that a focus on institutional investors is necessary in order to develop a more complete understanding of the shift towards neoliberal social relations of production. More precisely, it argues that institutional investors possess specific characteristics which are serving to reproduce neoliberal restructuring in both coercive and consensual ways. In terms of the former, it argues that the rise of institutional investors has led to a centralization of investment decision making and to a situation in which neoliberalism is being reproduced in a coercive fashion. In terms of consent, this article argues that the specific characteristics of institutional investors are serving to link a broad range of interests in civil society to those of financial institutions. Taken as whole, this analysis contributes to the growing international relations scholarship which identifies the increasing power of non-state actors in the international system and their role in the contemporary process of restructuring.;

DE;"development; commodity chains; services; tourism; globalization";
ID;POLICY;
AB;Global commodity chains (GCC) present a fairly new and innovative approach for understanding the prospects for development among Third World countries within a larger environment characterized by globalization. To date, most research using the framework concentrates on the changing organization of manufacturing activities and helps to explain why the chains touch down where they do. This article concentrates on two related questions: what can commodity chains tell us about the globalization of services and to what extent do services suggest the need to refine the GCC approach? Both questions are examined by focusing upon tourism, the largest service activity in the world. Concentrating on hotels and airlines, the article demonstrates that tourism services have become internationalized in a manner unlike manufacturing activities. Most notably, organizational or governance structures do not conform to either buyer-driven or producer-driven models frequently predicted by GCC analysis. The article concludes that while commodity chain analysis is useful for examining the political economy of tourism, especially in highlighting power and exchange relationships, it must be broadened to 'account' fully for the unique organization of the global tourism industry.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
ID;"AGRICULTURE; INTERNATIONALIZATION; MARKET; SYSTEM; STATE";
AB;The agrarian question, Like most questions about the trajectory of (capitalist) development, was framed as a national question about a national process. This article critiques the latter assumption, arguing, as Karl Polanyi did, that the classical agrarian question was a national interpretation of a global process. It also argues that the current processes of globalization crystallize the agrarian question in new and challenging ways. The key to these arguments is that the capitalist organization of agriculture is a political process, and is central to the dynamics of an evolving state system (including supra-statal institutions). The discussion contextualizes agricultural developments within the contradictory dynamics of the two main periods of world capitalism over the last century: the national (developmentalist) and the global movements. The crisis of developmentalism coincides with the crisis of the post-Second World War food regime. It is currently generating new social movements that combine original and tenure questions with food and green questions, reversing the anti-agrarianism of the development, or productivist, paradigm.;

ID;"GLOBALIZATION; DISTRICTS; FORDISM; STATES";
AB;This article argues that concepts and empirical characterizations of globalization and corporate organization drawn from the international political economy literature must be interrogated critically before being extended to agro-food studies. A brief survey of this literature reveals divergent conceptualizations of globalization and conflicting views of the state. For greater clarity, an ideal-typical taxonomy of world-scale processes and corporate organizational forms is proposed. It is suggested that contemporary global restructuring represents the combined yet uneven interaction of concurrent world-scale processes. This framework is used to discuss the limitations of some recent analyses of the globalization of agro-food systems and offer suggestions for future research.;

The use of the actor network perspective is suggested to enhance our understanding of the globalization process. To illustrate the applicability of actor network theory to political economy studies, the globalization of the Canadian rapeseed (Brassica rapa and B. napus) industry is analyzed. It is shown that the globalization of the rapeseed industry proceeded through three simultaneously occurring developments: modification of relationships among people and plants; extension of rapeseed production networks; and redistribution of power, wealth and status among the actors engaged in global rapeseed production networks. Implications of the actor network approach for political economy studies are discussed.";

DE;"chaos; state failure; television; governmentality; videocameralistics";
ID;"NEW-WORLD ORDER; SPACE";
AB;The discourse of state failure is a post-Cold War era phenomenon which provides a point of entry into the problematic of global regulation and governance after the Cold War. The mass media spectacles of chaos in the 1990s - in Iraq, Somalia and Rwanda - are windows into three overlapping dynamics which are re-mastering regulation and governance in the post-Cold War world. The first of these dynamics is the specter of state failure in international politics. The second is the power of global media machines as omnipresent visualization technologies, which are infecting and disrupting the political project of envisioning global order by hegemonic institutions and actors. The third dynamic is the regulatory imperatives of economic growth and political stability exerted by hegemonic states and institutions upon the strong and the weak alike. This article seeks to theorize critically the webs of power spun by all three, elaborating in the process a Foucauldian-inspired concept - videocameralistics - to describe their interweaving operation.;

DT;Article;
DE;"technology; world-economy; South Korea; development; economic restructuring; electronics";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INDUSTRY; LOCATION; DIVISION; LABOR";
AB;Recent conceptualizations of international economic restructuring and 'global commodity chains' offer an opportunity to rethink the role of technology in the world-system and its role in generating global inequality. This article attempts to untangle the complex relationship between technological innovation/application/transfer and differential patterns of socioeconomic growth and development. After reviewing key theoretical debates about the nature of global economic 'restructuring', I discuss the recent experience of South Korea, where planners and policy makers are acutely aware of the need to develop indigenous science and technology capabilities. Drawing on secondary sources as well as interviews with government officials, academic experts and corporate engineers, I argue that even the seemingly 'hi-tech' South Korean economy is characterized by technological dependence. The ultimate success of Korean efforts to promote 'industrial upgrading', market directly to lucrative world markets, and join the ranks of the 'advanced' economies continues to hinge on the ability of the South Korean state and corporations to break the oligopolistic control of technology held by core interests, who still reap a disproportionate share of global profits/surplus.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Editorial Material;
DE;"critical theory; Hegel; Marx; commodification; globalization; capitalism";
AB;Two views are outlined on the question of how social theory, and specifically the theory of capitalist society, can and should be relevant to political action. For the 'instrumentalist' view the theory cannot provide political actors with ultimate ends, but can only give them a diagram of the social mechanism which they can use in working out means to those ends. By contrast, for the 'formative' view, which is exemplified by Hegel's view of the role of philosophy in historical change, theory should act as a mirror to social subjects, showing them the nature of their own activity and thereby inducing a transformation in their basic ends. Some ways are discussed in which a theory of capitalism could play such a formative role for its subjects. It is then argued that, in order to play this role effectively, a formative theory of capitalism would need to abstract from any of the putative dynamics internal to capitalism, such as those of globalization and progressive commodification, which are discussed in the following articles. Theory that deals with such tendencies must stand in an instrumental relationship to political action.;

They comprise not only market mechanisms but money and energy,space and time regimes. Especially under the pressures of globalization disembedded money, fossil energies, abstract time and space act as external constraints of the world market on social systems. Societies have to adjust structurally to the conditions set by compulsory mechanisms. How do they work? In order to give an answer to this question the authors examine the structure of markets, particularly the world market. External constraints are important for the possibilities of democratic participation; disembedding mechanisms restrict democracy's place.";

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"the state; capitalism; new social movements; globalization; networks";
AB;Using a model distinguishing local, national, inter-national, transnational and global interaction networks, I analyse four supposed 'threats' to nation-states - global capitalism, environmental danger, identity politics and post-nuclear geopolitics. All four actually impact differently on nation-states in different regions, contain both state-weakening and strengthening tendencies, and increase the significance of inter-national as well as transnational networks. Capitalist transformation is slightly weakening the nation-states of the north (most clearly so within the EU), yet economic development would strengthen southern nation-states. The decline of 'hard geopolitics' in a post-nuclear age weakens northern, but not most southern, states. Yet 'soft geopolitics' is everywhere bringing new state functions and maintaining the strength of inter-national networks. Identity politics, contrary to most views, probably strengthens nationally bound politics. These patterns are too varied to permit us to argue simply either that the nation-state and the nation-state system are strengthening or weakening. But the expansion of global networks seems to weaken local interaction networks more than national ones.;

TI;The state of globalization: towards a theory of state transformation;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"state; globalization; nation-state; governance; global; international";
AB;This article argues that it is erroneous to counterpose globalization to the state, as many increasingly sterile debates in the social sciences have done. Globalization does not undermine the state but includes the transformation of state forms: it is both predicated on and produces such transformations. The reason for the false counterposition of the state and globalization is that the debates rest on inadequate theorizations of the state, and it is these which the article seeks to address. This article is therefore in two parts. In the first, I seek to identify the dominant contemporary form of the state not as the nation-state, but as a massive, institutionally complex and messy agglomeration of state power centred on North America, western Europe, Japan and Australasia, which I call the western state. I argue that since 1989, the global role of this western state has undergone further important transformations and it is becoming possible to see the western state as a global form of state power.;
;In the second part, I ask how the globally dominant western state can be understood in terms of state theory, and argue that we should understand this state form as an emergent global state. I discuss Michael Mann's definition of the state, and take the four elements of this in turn, arguing that the emergent global state can be considered a state in these terms. I argue, however, that an additional fifth criterion needs to be added if we are to make sense of the situation of overlapping levels of state power, i.e. that a state must be to a significant degree inclusive and constitutive of other forms or levels of state power (of state power in general in a particular time and space). Recognizing that the inclusiveness and constitutiveness of the various transnational forms of state are not easy to determine, I conclude that the global state is evidently a problematic level of state power, whose western core remains in many ways stronger than the global form itself. I conclude by explicating the nature of contemporary nation-states and the great variation in their relations with global state power.;

ID;"POLICY; MALL";
AB;The thesis that 'Capitalism does not just happen' is argued with reference to Gramsci, hegemony and the critique of state centrism. This involves a critique of the assumption that ruling classes rule effortlessly, and raises the issue: Does globalization increase the pressures on ruling classes to deliver? Global system theory is outlined in terms of transnational practices in the economic, political, and culture and ideology spheres and the characteristic institutional forms of these, the transnational corporation, transnational capitalist class and the culture-ideology of consumerism. The transnational capitalist class is organized in four overlapping fractions: TNC executives, globalizing bureaucrats, politicians and professionals, consumerist elites (merchants and media). Social movements for global capitalism and elite social movement organizations (ESMOs) are analysed. Each of the four fractions of the TCC has its own distinctive organizations, some of which take on social movement-like characteristics.;

AB;This article challenges the currently fashionable periodization of history since the eighteenth century into two major phases, 'modernity' and 'postmodernity'. Questioning the conception of 'modernity' itself, Wood emphasizes the specificity of capitalism in opposition to other aspects of modernity with which it is conventionally associated, and argues that if we are now witnessing an epochal shift, it is not a transition from 'modernity' to 'postmodernity' but the maturation and universalization of capitalism. The 'universalization' of capitalism is then distinguished from 'globalization', a concept which, she argues, obscures more than it reveals.;

AB;The article relates capitalism's distinctive dynamic to the nature of the wage relation and self-valorization of capital. Capitalism has no final telos: its future remains open in the face of structural changes and social struggles. This source of capitalist dynamism also opens it to external influence. Some key changes in the 'government and governance' of economics and politics are also discussed. These include: the denationalization of statehood, a partial de-statization of politics, and the internationalization of policy regimes. Among counter-trends are the survival of the national state as an instance of meta-governance.;

DE;"public international law; private international law; public/private distinction; international trade law";
ID;"PUBLIC PRIVATE DISTINCTION; STATE";
AB;"This article examines the distinction between public and private international law, arguing that it is not reflective of an organic, natural or inevitable separation. Rather, the distinction is presented as an analytical construct that evolved with the emergence of the bourgeois state. The public/private distinction provided the ideological conditions for the emergence of liberal market economies and, in law, formed the foundation for territorially individuated state authority. However, contemporary developments in capitalist production and finance are reconfiguring the private and public spheres and contributing to the empirical decline of the distinction. The distinction remains very powerful symbolically, however; this is attributed to the influence of neoliberal ideology that asserts the superiority of private law in the regulation of international commerce. An alliance between private and public authorities who are united in their commitment to the expansion of capitalism through disembedding international commerce from national, social and democratic controls is advancing this ideology and contributing to the troubling and paradoxical exercise of public authority by private actors.";

AB;Some trade frictions are more important than others because they represent changes or possible changes in systemic economic leadership. Based on several strong assumptions about the nature of international political economy, a multivariate model that differentiates between political economic challenges that lead to intense, militarized conflicts and those that do not is constructed. Ten iterations of challenges over the past millennium provide empirical support for the applicability of the model. Provided that the model's assumptions continue to hold, it also has clear implications for evaluating the long-term conflict potential of the ongoing US-Japanese commercial competition. While an intense challenge is quite possible, a militarized conflict between Japan and the United States over economic leadership some time in the twenty-first century is not the most probable scenario.;

ID;INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS THEORY;
AB;"Neorealism relies on an unacknowledged and pessimistic reading of the theory of spontaneous order - developed originally by Adam Smith and other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment - in order to drive a wedge between action and its intended results. This reading allows neorealists to veil their practical and theoretical commitments to the virtues of anarchy, inequality and hegemony in international society. An examination of theories of spontaneous order reveals, however, that the conclusions of the theory are more likely to follow when agents are knowledgeable about their social context. Knowledgeability implies human reflexivity suggesting that even institutions emerging spontaneously can become infused with human design. Such reflexivity implies not a clear separation but an overlap between intentions and outcomes. This overlap means that: (1) the study of intended action needs to become a required part of international relations theory; and (2) favored international outcomes necessitate an explicit discussion of the values that drive theory and practice.";

AB;This article sets the question of globalization of economic coordination (which it briefly criticizes) in the context of how such coordination is managed 'on the ground'. The region, the sub-state administrative entity found in most advanced economies, is argued to be a crucial element not least because evolving processes of economic coordination increasingly depend upon regional economies. Increasingly, too, such economies come to depend for key functions on the governance powers of regional administrations. The more progressive of these operate a 'decentralized industry policy' which promotes institutional learning, often through associational practices. An empirical study of two members of a recently developed European regional economic partnership, the 'European Motor Regions', Wales and Baden-Wurttemberg, illustrates the evolutionary processes in question.;

AB;This article argues that the decision by Nordic elites to link their respective currencies to an ECU basket is consistent with a Trojan horse strategy for membership in the European Union. After alternative explanations for ECU linkage are tested, the article shows how Nordic elites used their control over exchange rate regime choices to facilitate greater EU participation, in spite of the hesitancy voiced by domestic constituents. In order to make the argument, Putnam's two-level metaphor is amended to accommodate a bargaining situation where negotiators have independent policy preferences. This amended model provides seven lessons for negotiators willing to manipulate win-set contours with an eye toward affecting public support. These lessons are then juxtaposed with the Nordic decisions to link their currencies to an ECU basket. The article concludes that ECU linkage can be explained in terms of, and is consistent with, a strategy based on the EU ambitions of Nordic political elites.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Taylorization; post-Fordism; ecology; international division of labour; continental blocs; international hierarchy";
AB;This article was first presented as the RIPE annual lecture at Durham University on 7 November 1995. It seeks to explore the transformation of the capital-labour relation in the aftermath of the postwar crisis of Fordism. It examines how various solutions to this crisis, in the developed world, the newly industrialized world and, latterly, the former socialist bloc, have brought about a radical restructuring of the world's economic hierarchy. One consequence has been the emergence of continental blocs characterized by the heterogeneity of the economic systems within their sphere. The coexistence of countries with differing labour regimes within integrated continental blocs is the primary focus, with each bloc analysed in turn for its particular aspects. This leads to consideration of the possibility of a third international division of labour. The article concludes with an examination of an unexpected consequence of this restructuring, namely the relation between systems of labour-capital relations and attitudes towards global ecological crisis.;

AB;"This article has two main tasks. The first is to trace the lineage of academic writings since the time of Adam Smith, on the respective roles of markets, hierarchies, inter-firm alliances and governments as modes of organizing economic activity in a capitalist economy; and, also, to analyze why, and in what ways, economists, political scientists and organizational theorists have differed in their interpretation of the optimal role of governments. The second is to examine the implications of the internationalization and more recently the globalization, of economic activity for the governance of resource creation and deployment, and the extant to which national administrations and supranational regimes need to modify their agendas and policy prescriptions in the light of the growing mobility of many tangible and intangible assets. The article will further argue that changing patterns of demand and technological advances - especially as they have impacted on the coordinating and transaction costs of value added activity, and on the institutions and cultural infrastructures underpinning such activity - have critically affected the merits of alternative modes of economic organization; and that, over the years, the optimal combination of these modes has undergone a marked change.";

DE;"Eastern Europe; Latin America; democratic transitions; political institutions; social structures; economic reform";
ID;"STATE; GOVERNMENT; DEMOCRACY; HUNGARY";
AB;This article develops a structural and institutional framework for exploring the prospects for stable democracy in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Its guiding premise is that democratic consolidation hinges on the willingness of societal actors to use the party system as their primary medium of interest articulation. The structural analysis examines how the resources of agents in different socioeconomic systems influence their affinity for party or non-party strategies. The institutional component assesses how party and state institutions reshape actors' strategic incentives. Integrating the two logics leads to the following argument: market structures in the developing capitalist countries of Latin America encourage economic elites to circumvent the democratic process. Structural conditions in Eastern Europe's transitional socialist countries induce a wider range of actors to employ party strategies, but place anti-democratic elements in a favored position within the electoral arena. Democratic consolidation in the two regions necessitates the building of party and state institutions capable of overcoming these structural impediments.;

DE;"capital mobility; trade policy; investment; automobile industry; Canada; United States";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; STATES";
AB;Capital mobility is a central determinant of trade policy. Increasing capital mobility creates pressures for trade liberalization, which in itself represents a further increase in capital mobility. Not only does increasing capital mobility orient firm preferences to reducing barriers to trade and strengthen firms relative to other actors in society, it raises the costs to governments of protection, in terms of employment, consumer prices, production and balance of payments effects. Governments can accept these costs, which is why trade liberalization is not automatic, but it is likely that governments will eventually liberalize, as did Canada in the case examined here. This article thus seeks to extend recent work on the trade preferences of multinational corporations by demonstrating the independent yet complementary effects of capital mobility on firm and government preferences.;

AB;"In an era of global changes the fate of the nation-state is of crucial importance for evert student of political economy. This much is indeed reflected in the wide attention recently paid to the implications of globalization an the nation-state. Unfortunately, the point of view of the political economy of nationalism is largely unexplored in this discussion, Thus, this article discusses Friedrich List's political economy in order to shed light on the economic role of the state, List is recognized today worldwide as one of the most influential trade theorists and as one of the first to popularize the theory of 'infant industries'. Yet this recognition only partly reflects his significance as a political economist. The main assertion of this article is that in order to discuss the fate of the nation-state we must first be able to clarify its economic roles. This, in turn, may lead us to the conclusion that cur;ent assertions concerning the so-called 'diminishing autonomy of the state' as well as the 'imperative of globalization' are over-stressed under the influence of laissez-faire conception of political economy.";

AB;The development of a new data set on the 1800-1990 average nominal tariff rates of five of the system's most important traders (Britain, France, the United States, Germany and Japan) permits a new empirical examination of alternative explanations of protectionism. Seven models, with various emphases on hegemony, business cycles, war shocks and economic growth, are used to generate nine schedules of expected changes in the direction of tariff rates. Correlations of the expected schedules with the observed directional shifts demonstrate clearly the timing superiority of explanations based on long wave and external shock emphases. Yet even the strongest performing models do less well at levels of analysis other than the system level. Greater model elaboration, it is concluded, is needed to better account for processes at work in different subsystems.;

DE;"Hegemony; internationalization; globalism; post-coloniality; China; corporatism";
AB;Gramscian globalists presume that internationalization means externalization, modernization, and Westernization, thereby enhancing the world-hegemony of Western liberal capitalism. This paper proposes instead that internationalization mutates the world-hegemony sometimes into non-Western, non-liberal orders of regional-hegemony. As a case study, this paper focuses on China's internationalization into an Asian Corporatist regional-hegemony in the 1980s-1990s.(1);

TI;Manufacturing' investment: national variations in the contribution of foreign direct investors to the US manufacturing base in the 1990s;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Foreign direct investment; American manufacturing base; competitiveness; regime theory";
AB;Debates over the course of the last decade within the United States on the 'who is us?' question have tended to focus on the virtues and vices of corporate citizenship in the abstract - with little empirical analysis. Although regarded by many critics as a parochial deliberation, the US remains the single largest destination for, and source of, foreign investment Any shift away from the historic policy of open access, a principle coined by the term 'national treatment', would therefore seriously undermine attempts to sustain or expand an open investment regime.;
;The article outlines the evolving policy options currently being debated by policy makers in the United States and then analyzes the behavior of the affiliates of foreign investors in the United States. The evidence presented by Reich suggests that tremendous variations are evident in patterns of investment according to the nationality of the affiliate, with significant implications for both the value of such investments to the US economy, and for the future direction of US domestic policy. The evidence presented indicates that investments by Japanese affiliates prove least beneficial to the US economy as measured by either the transfer of technology or of highly skilled manufacturing jobs to the United States, compared to other major investors. The sustained reliance by Japanese affiliates on traditional business practices that emphasize investment as a conduit for further trade defies the expectations of traditional liberal 'product cycle' theory, and may partially explain the resilience of the bilateral trade deficit. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications for US policy makers, as well as those for maintaining an open investment regime should these policy makers abandon a policy of national treatment;

TI;Comparing GATT and GATS: regime creation under and after hegemony;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Trade policy; international regimes; hegemony; multilateral negotiations; services; GATT";
AB;This article makes a comparison between the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), that came into force in 1995, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947. It compares regime creation under and after alleged US hegemony and the analysis concentrates on US considerations. It shows that the shift from a hegemonic to a multipolar power structure has affected both the form and content of GATS, as compared to GATT. A change of emphasis from diffuse towards specific reciprocity can be noted. This has resulted in a weakening of the principle of non-discrimination, as embodied in the rules on most-favored-nation and national treatment. In particular the US has emphasized the need to avoid free riders under GATS. The new power structure has led regime leaders to develop new methods of international cooperation in the field of trade, such as the search for liberalizing commitments from a 'critical mass' of countries. Without such commitments the US has not been willing to make full commitments on an m.f.n.-basis of its own. This has made negotiations more difficult, and heavily influences the outcome in key sectors such as financial, maritime and telecommunication services.;

TI;Bilateral and multilateral foreign aid: Japan's approach in comparative perspective;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Foreign aid; Japanese aid; public goods; US aid";
AB;We propose and apply a crude categorization of development aid forms ranging from those with a larger private to a larger public goods component. We reason that the degree of 'privateness' is greatest with the highest probability of direct financial compensation and the greatest control by the 'national' donor (be it private or public sector). This categorization is used to comparatively analyze foreign aid spending by Japan, the United States, and the entire Development Assistance Committee (DAC). With specific regard to Japan, we conclude that neither the most negative interpretations or the most positive claims seem fully warranted. Japan clearly is not empty-headed about aid, purely selfish, or simply a follower of others. And the US record is not compatible with comprehensive claims for American leadership and special devotion to public goods provision in the world political-economy through use of the foreign aid tool. Our findings also suggest, however, that Japanese movement toward a larger world role is of a somewhat different nature than has traditionally been seen in the American or DAC approach to aid. Emphasis on the loans components of official development assistance (ODA) and a somewhat higher tendency to funnel resources into aid categories exhibiting higher production of public goods outcomes demonstrate an apparently counter-balanced, yet unique, pattern of aid-giving behavior.;

TI;'Robin Hood' politics? Turkey missing the chance to adopt a new model in the 1990s;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Conditionality; export promotion; foreign investment; interest groups; private business; Turkey";
AB;The 1991 elections brought a coalition between the centre right and the social democratic party to power. It tried to prevent Turkey from taking yet another plunge into economic and political instability which has punctuated post-war Turkish history. Its aim was to adopt economic policies attaching more importance to redistribution and relying on the participation of a wider range of social actors. This paper deals with the question whether this endeavour was bound to fail from the outset or not. The contention is that it was not. 'Imperatives of international competition' do not impede redistributive policies although they make them more difficult. However, Turkey was in an unusually advantageous situation for confronting them. Moreover, increasing social and political discontent and the related surge in Islamic political activity made the influential private business groups actively support a policy shift. But the government failed to seize this support early which made its later demand that business share the costs of redistribution appear as the consequence of government incompetence. The policies therefore foundered on the obstuction of businessmen, who took government incompetence as a convenient excuse for withdrawing their support. The chance to adopt new economic policies and find new ways of dealing with Turkey's social and political cleavages has been forgone.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Globalization; Marx; Polanyi; Braudel; world-systems theory; 'financialization'";
AB;This article seeks to place contemporary globalization in its right historical place, in two senses. First, it assumes that globalization, associated with the spread and deepening of capitalism, has a long history. It therefore asks what aspects of contemporary globalization can be considered genuinely new. Second, the article offers a historicized perspective, and draws on Marx, Braudel, Polanyi and world-systems theory to defend a non-economistic interpretation of capitalist globalization. It stresses the need to recognize the social and institutional contextualization of globalization in time and space, but without losing sight of the core principles of marxist analysis.;

TI;What's modern about the modern world-system? Introducing ordinary modernity through world hegemony;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"American decline; Americanization; comfort; hegemony; modernity; ordinariness";
AB;Interpreting modernity as constituting practices to cope with the perpetual change deriving from the capitalist imperative to ceaseless accumulation, it is argued that world hegemonic states create exceptional periods of change which stimulate major constructions of modernity. The nature of these modernities is explored through the creative arts where the hegemon's civil society has been a cultural as well as an economic leader. A celebration of ordinariness is found which is related to social practices to create ordinary modernity. The core concept of this form of modernity is comfort, and the hegemonic contribution to creating home comforts culminating in twentieth-century suburbia is charted. The latter is implicated in an Americanization of the world that leads to an unsustainable world system. The irony of the article, therefore, is that it sees ordinary modernity leading to an extraordinary world impasse.;

TI;A theory of transnational revolution: universal history according to Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy and its implications;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Revolution; transnationalization; globalization; philosophy of history; nationality; political theory";
AB;This article builds on the neo-Hegelian theory of European revolutions as developed by Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. This theory considers the major revolutions, from the era of the Crusades to the Bolshevik Revolution, as part of a single time/space structure. It holds that each revolution provoked the next by implanting so-called 'pressure points' abroad, while shaping the culture of an era and a particular national character in the country of origin. In the postwar east-west confrontation, this structure supposedly achieved its final shape. The article argues that the finality of this universal history can be transcended if we recognize that social innovations resulting from the earlier of these revolutions paved the way for the emergence and growth of capital. From about 1800, all further revolutions faced an existing universalism of capital, connected to an English-speaking heartland, which constrained their development. With the end of the Cold War, revolutions establishing national/regional identities are no longer trapped in this geopolitical stalemate. Current struggles against globalization may mark the first instalment of such a revolution.;

TI;Understanding trade bloc formation: the case of the ASEAN Free Trade Area;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Trade blocs; economic integration; ASEAN Free Trade Area; regionalism";
AB;The formation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 1991 marks a significant change in attitudes towards preferential trading arrangements in the region. In this article, we examine why such a change in policy came about In so doing, we conclude that mainstream economic approaches do not provide satisfactory explanations for the formation of AFTA. In large measure this is due, we argue, to an overly simplistic explanation of, or disregard for, state behaviour and/or an ahistorical approach which fails to consider the purpose of trading blocs in the global economy of the 1990s. We provide an alternative explanation for the formation of ASEAN which points to the need for an explicit analysis of the political economy of ASEAN states and ASEAN's relationship to the global economy.;

AB;In Europe as in the world, national economies are following divergent trajectories in their way out of the crisis of Fordism. Some rely on 'negotiated involvement of workers', others on the flexibility of the wage contract. This creates a centre-periphery type hierarchy between countries. Unfortunately the Maastricht treaty implies rules of the game which induce countries to shift towards the 'flexibility' solution. The text advocates some reforms that could induce a socially preferable general evolution, notably towards shorter labour-time.;

This conclusion is reached by addressing three issues: the problem of universal and specific assumptions in economic analysis; the question of 'necessary impurities' in an economic system; and the relationship between actor and structure. It is concluded that institutional economics is most sensitive to the immense actual and potential variety within capitalism itself, and recognizes that the development of different capitalist systems can be divergent rather than convergent.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Locality; globalization; socialization; class; Keynesianism; neo-liberalism";
AB;"The last twenty years have seen the rise of local economic initiatives in the developed capitalist countries. Despite the dominance of neo-liberalism at the national level, most of these local programmes are neo-Keynesian, seeking to use non-market coordination pragmatically to address market failures and to use localism to develop active cooperation, between the state, capital and sometimes labour and residents. This article argues that, despite their promise, neo-Keynesian local strategies suffer from major problems and unintended consequences. These originate in the attempt to privilege the productive, coordinated, socialized and territorially defined aspects of capitalism over private ownership, value discipline and geographical mobility; these two sets of traits in reality are both mutually dependent and inevitably in conflict. The limits of neo-Keynesian localism are ultimately set by struggle within and between classes, structured in important ways by geographical scale.";

TI;Reconceptualizing autonomy: the difference dependency theory makes;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Dependency; sovereignty; culture; post-development; international inequality; ethics";
AB;Though now largely ignored or maligned, the legacy of dependency thinking remains to be claimed. Of particular importance is the way dependency theorists mobilize the logic of sovereignty as a challenge to the hierarchy constructed as a capitalist global division of labor. However, this embrace of sovereignty creates perplexities for dependency argument: though the basis for a challenge to international inequality, sovereign boundaries also contribute to hierarchy and its legitimation by demarcating states as essentially independent political-economic units. The dependency critique exposes (although may not fully articulate) this tension, and points to the need to reconceptualize our understanding of the autonomy of political communities in more relational terms. This relational understanding of autonomy necessitates untangling the multiple functions of boundaries and reconfiguring territorial space, at least for certain purposes, as simultaneously global and national. Any attempt to retrieve the legacy of dependency theory in this way must confront the broader questioning or rejection of the political-economic configurations of modernity associated with the recent 'post-development' turn of thought. Though appropriately chastened by the post-development highlighting of local difference/autonomy, the lessons of dependency theory remain vital if we are, on the one side, to avoid the temptation to romanticize local difference - redeploying boundaries as a demarcation of essentially independent (albeit local) units - and, on the other side, to secure the place for a challenge to international inequality.;

DE;"Development; economics; finance; international economics; international relations; public finance";
AB;The global foreign exchange market, with a turnover of over $1 trillion daily, is the world's largest and most liquid financial market. It has certain inefficiencies, however, being actually a two-tier market - a competitive interbank market and a publicly quoted captive market of end users. Creating a foreign currency exchange (FXE), to serve the foreign currency market as national bourses serve securities markets, could abolish these inefficiencies. It could promote order, transparency and increased competition, lower transaction costs, and be justified by the fact that transnational activities such as foreign exchange trading use the global commons and depend on global governance. From user fees lower than the premiums consumers now pay when changing currencies with banks - at present their only recourse - FXE could realize vast revenues, which could be used for peacekeeping, development and other functions of the international public sector.;

TI;The development of development theory: towards critical globalism;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Development theory; globalism; globalization; modernization theory";
AB;This article presents, first, two arguments in the mode of development discourse analysis. Development thinking is usually regarded as an offshoot of the family of notions of evolution and progress and as part of western notions of change as growth. On the basis of a genealogy of development theory, this perspective is questioned. It displays an essentialism of ideas, overlooks discontinuities within western thought, exaggerates the special character of western notions of change, and privileges endogenous over exogenous change. The second argument is to view development theories in the plural - diverging in terms of sociology and economics and in relation to different sectors. In each of these spheres different theories have been prevalent. In development theory, endogenous models of development have predominated to the neglect of diffusionist perspectives. The closing argument concerns the challenge of globalization, seeks to redefine development as global development, and argues for an in-between position of critical globalism.;

TI;The geography of collective identities in a globalizing world;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Globalization; identity; geography; social change; community; deterritorialization";
ID;WOMEN;
AB;One of the many key questions in the political economy of globalization concerns the implications of this broad trend for forms of collective identity and the associated shapes and strengths of communities in the contemporary world system. Globalization - conceived here in a distinctly geographical sense as the rise of supraterritoriality - has contributed to a general shift over recent decades away from a situation thoroughly dominated by national identities. Globalization has helped to reinvigorate or newly invent a host of substate localisms as well as a diverse array of transborder solidarities. Concurrently, recent moves away from territorialist geography have in other respects reproduced the nationality principle and have also prompted a number of nationalist reactions. These different and often contradictory tendencies have resulted in widespread fragmentation of identities in the world political economy of the late twentieth century. The article concludes with some (admittedly problematic) suggestions for the construction of fluid, post-nationalist global communities of difference.;

TI;Putting the state in its place: US foreign policy and differential capital accumulation in Middle East 'energy conflicts';
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Capital accumulation; oil; arms exports; multinational corporations; Middle East conflicts; US foreign policy";
ID;OIL;
AB;This is the second in a series of two articles looking into the interaction between differential capital accumulation and Middle East 'energy conflicts'. Examining the historical record since the late 1960s, we find US policies to have been increasingly consistent with the coinciding differential interests of a Weapondollar-Petrodollar coalition of large defence contractors and oil companies. Contrary to aggregate views which emphasize the 'national interest' or the broad imperatives of capital accumulation - but in line with the differential interests of these companies - US policies in the region seem to have contributed towards greater instability, imposed limits on the free flow of oil and led to higher unstable prices. Most significantly, every 'energy conflict' since the late 1960s was preceded by adverse drops in the differential rate of profit of the large oil companies, which then promptly recovered in the wake of the ensuing crisis. While the US government was officially seeking regional conciliation, it passively or actively endorsed each one of these conflicts. The current peace drive between Israel and its Arab neighbours is overshadowed by negative differential profits for the oil companies and depressed weapon sales for the arms contractors. Left unresolved, these predicaments could eventually culminate in a new 'energy conflict'.;

TI;Market reforms and corruption in Latin America: new means for old ways;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Market reform; privatization; corruption; Argentina; Brazil; Venezuela";
AB;Many liberal economists hail market-oriented reforms as a means to combat corruption in emerging Latin American democracies with state-led economies. Such arguments assume that reforms like privatization and market deregulation by definition will eliminate the politicians' ability to use state enterprises and government regulations to their own personal advantage. However, there has been little academic scrutiny of how these reforms have been actually implemented in Latin America. In this article, we contend that, unless market reforms are pursued in a context of transparency, they can be used as new means to pursue old corrupt ends. We begin by constructing an actor-centered model of corruption as a function of willingness and opportunity. We then develop two hypotheses regarding die influence of economic reform on the opportunity structure for corruption: executive discretionary power will increase, and the modalities of corruption will adapt to put the economic reforms to corrupt use. An analysis of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela lends support to our hypotheses. The article concludes with a consideration of the implications of these findings for the future of corruption, economic reform and democracy in less developed countries.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Germany; hegemony; economic power; consensual democracy; Modell Deutschland";
AB;German economic power in Europe is uncontested. What is contested are its effects on Germany's neighbors. Accompanying the obvious benefits that accrue to Europe from German economic might are also potential disadvantages, particularly that of dependence. Data on Germany's relationship with countries in both East and West Europe shed light on this issue. This study suggests that the benefits outweigh any associated costs, thus rendering Germany a benign hegemon.;

TI;United States trade policies at loggerheads: Super 301, the Uruguay Round and Indian services trade liberalization;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"United States; India; trade policy; Super 301; GATT; Uruguay Round; services";
AB;In the 1980s the US government sought to encourage India to liberalize its trade regime in services and foreign investment. US officials sought to achieve their objective by naming India to the 1988 Trade Act's 'Super 301' list of target countries for mandatory market-opening negotiations under threat of retaliation while at the same time also pursuing Indian trade liberalization multilaterally under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round negotiations. The two policies were uncoordinated and incompatible, and ultimately the Super 301 cases against India were terminated when US officials realized that they risked damaging prospects of success under the Uruguay Round talks. As a case study the US-India case exposes weaknesses in the ability of state actor-based theories of hegemonic stability as well as domestic politics and institutions-based explanations alone to yield a full account of interest formation and policy formulation. An integrative theoretical approach taking account of the role of epistemic communities is required to provide the fullest explanation both of individual decision making and institutional and structural factors.;

TI;The ambivalent hegemon: explaining the 'lost decade' in multilateral trade talks, 1948-1958;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"GATT; trade; Truman; Eisenhower; negotiation; hegemony";
AB;Hegemonic stability theory and its variants point to the dominance of the United States and its commitment to multilateralism and liberalism in the early post-Second World War period as the key ingredients to the establishment of a liberal world trading order as embodied in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The present study challenges this image on several fronts by focusing on the GATT multilateral trade negotiations between 1948 and 1958. The historical review shows that US attachment to liberal principles was susceptible to reversal under moderate congressional pressure and its influence in GATT negotiations constrained by European assertiveness and linkage of trade talks to security priorities, although not from any deep commitment to multilateralism as such. The account reinforces the notion that international cooperation is less the product of hegemonic unilateralism and more the outcome of bargaining and exchange between multiple parties both in and out of the institutional structure.;

TI;The 'Long Night of the First Republic': years of clientelistic implosion in Italy;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Political economy; international relations; Italy; clientelism; legitimacy crisis; welfare state; party-system; family business; organized crime";
AB;Several analysts have explained the end of the postwar political system in Italy as an effect of the end of the Cold War. Deprived of the anti-communist glue, Italians were, so the story goes, finally free to replace the corrupted regime. The present article argues instead that the recent changes should be seen as the effect of transnational and societal dynamics on modern welfare states that have upset the consociational/clientelistic bargain on which Italy's domestic political economy rested. The success of the judiciary campaign mani pulite ('clean hands') has been triggered by the concomitant financial crisis of the state, its parties and principal Italian industries which undermined the major actors' ability to uphold their clientelistic systems.;
;Such a thesis presupposes a methodological shift away from simple 'outside-in' explanations. It focuses instead on the interaction between different transnational and/or societal self-sustaining networks whose borders need not necessarily coincide with state borders. In the present context of rampant globalization, the inner development and linkage between the party system, the welfare state, organized crime and the Italian version of capitalism are analysed as the main articulations of the overt/covert order upon which the Italian postwar social contract rested. As long as the basic problems of this contract remain unsolved, as for instance the insufficient distinction between the political and economic sphere or the systematic application of double standards, it seems premature to talk about a Second Italian Republic.;

DE;"Difference; empathetic cooperation; feminism; postmodernism; post-colonial; the Other";
AB;This paper demonstrates that advancing our understanding of international political economy (IPE) entails posing the question of otherness and difference as an object of theoretical and historical inquiry. It suggests that the discourses of postmodernism, feminism, and postcolonial criticism directly contribute to IPE by locating the problematic of identity/difference at the center of the dialectic of social change. By pinpointing the strength and the problematic nature of each of these discourses, it argues that the reconstruction of IPE based on the recognition of difference requires 'an empathetic cooperation' among these discourses as a precondition for the creation of a dialogical interaction between theoretical discourse and subject-positions to whom it is addressed.;

TI;Mapping, naming and remembering: globalization at the end of the twentieth century;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Aboriginal nationalisms; Canada; citizenship; globalization; nationalist movements; Quebec";
AB;This article contends that struggles over maps, names, and stories about the past are a crucial aspect of globalization. Specific results are never driven simply by macro sociological and economic structural processes. They follow, rather, from the politics out of which such struggles emerge, including revitalized and modernized nationalist movements. This article examines three movements active in Canadian politics today - Quebecois 'English-Canadian', and Aboriginal nationalisms. It does so in order to illustrate how globalization has created new possibilities for nationalist movements to make claims for expanded rights, including those of citizenship. In particular, the article argues that in recent constitutional debate a central concern of these three nationalist movements was the capacity of the national state to regulate within the territory of Canada. In making claims for recognition that is, in the politics of naming - the movements challenged traditional notions of sovereignty and the capacity of the Canadian state to exercise it. All three proposed a reconfiguration of space, by agitating for greater sovereignty and for different transnational linkages. Therefore, the story of these three nationalist movements illustrates the ways in which globalization both generates challenges to existing practices of states and nationalist movements and opens space for new political practice.;

DE;"Beauty; Belize; transnational; popular culture; Caribbean; pageants";
AB;Beauty pageants are an exemplar of global cultural flow, and the tensions between local and supranational production and reception of media events. This paper discusses the local history and political context of beauty pageantry in the Caribbean country of Belize. The pageants are portrayed as sites where Belizean identity is recast in a universalized language of difference and distinction. The political economy of beauty allows local production and interpretation only within a narrow semantic frame provided by the metropole.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"US-Latin American relations; Cold War; good neighbour; anti-communism; military and economic cooperation";
AB;Discourse helped structure relations between the United States and Latin America between 1945 and 1948. The US's new global supremacy changed how it acted towards Latin America. It changed the way US officials picked their interlocutors and it changed US perception of Latin American interests and priorities. US hegemony determined the new forms of relationships the US would establish in the postwar era. The change can be observed by considering three of the most important places where 'communication' took place between the two interlocutors, the US and the Latin American governments: the conferences in Chapultepec (1945), Rio de Janeiro (1947) and Bogota (1948). Ultimately, democratic tendencies in Latin America were frustrated by the new development in inter-American relations.;

TI;The 'will to civilization' and its encounter with laissez-faire;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Laissez-faire; political economy; civilization; race; gender; Colombia";
AB;This paper argues that we need to broaden the understanding of political economy beyond the circulation of 'things' so as to include forms of production, transformation and exchange of meanings. To illustrate the argument, the paper focuses on the contradictory encounter between two regimes of representation in nineteenth-century Colombia: the 'will to civilization' and laissez-faire. Because political economy was founded upon the desire to civilize classes, races and gender, the premises for laissez-faire could not be achieved. Arguments about local artisanship, the causes of poverty or the international division of labour were embedded in distinctions between the local and the European: ignorant artisans were contrasted with English workers, theory was preferred to reality and coarse textiles were compared to imported ones. Negative representation of female and Indian dresses increased the desire for imported textiles, which in turn led to the displacement of local manufactures in favour of European ones. In those nations imagined as deprived of civilization, the idea of a self-regulatory principle did not prosper. In Colombia, the formation of gender, class and racial identities within the 'will to civilization' regime of representation arrested the formation of an 'indifferent' capitalist labour market.;

Trapped by the neo-liberal turn in the 1980s, and unable to return to the Keynesian lending principles of earlier decades, the Bank is claimed to be facing an unsettled future in terms of its operational philosophy.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Interactive method; market transition; neoliberalism; post-socialism; social change";
AB;The negotiated strategy as an alternative to the liberal approach is based on the interactive method of social change. Implementing this strategy is no easy task. It calls for both a fundamental theoretical reassessment of the problem of systemic transformation as well as changes in habitual patterns of behaviour. Under post-socialist conditions, negotiations take on a double significance: on the one hand, they can create an institutional framework, establish the rules of the market game, and allow particular economic projects to be put into practice (the meso- and microstructural level). On the other hand, the resulting arrangements can be used as a basis for defining and implementing a precise strategy to shape the economic system, thus 'building up' the state (the macrostructural level). The implementation of the liberal approach based on the imperative method of social change has created an 'interaction crisis' in post-socialist societies. One of the major symptoms of this crisis is the contradiction between political articulation and institutionalization. It seems that the only effective, pro-transformation way of overcoming this contradiction would be to create structures able to bridge the gap between society and the authorities, and to mediate interests both between various social groups and between these groups and the authorities.;

AB;The crisis of global Fordism, the internationalization of capital, and the demise of national and international political regulation necessitates a thorough revision of conventional political concepts. These developments call in question the historical link between nation-state, democracy and human rights. While the nation-state is not disappearing, its significance is changing. It is becoming more and more difficult to secure democracy in a nation-state framework despite the lack of an alternative institutional terrain. This political dilemma can be overcome only if democratic political processes can be contextually and procedurally de-linked from the state system on both the national and international level.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Maritime; shipping; hegemony; system; class; Navigation Acts";
AB;Scholars of International Relations have generally presumed the existence of separate and analytically distinct 'levels of analysis'. For realists and neorealists, the state is considered to act more or less independently of domestic social forces, and explanation is sought primarily at the international systemic level, in terms of the imperatives of a given configuration of international power relations. Other theoretical traditions reject the assumption of the causal primacy of international structure, and the corollary assumption of the analytical separation of state and society. For the most part, however, 'domestic structures' have been granted a status as a second-order or supplementary variable, something to be 'added on' to systemic explanations. This has been particularly evident in theory and research on cycles of free trade and mercantilism.;
;This article seeks to develop a more synthetic account of the relationship between societies, states, and the global political economy by analyzing the relationship between the dominant or hegemonic power and the evolution of international shipping. The imperatives of global structure considered in isolation from domestic social forces do not adequately explain events. The global transformation of shipping results from the mutual interaction of concrete political and economic struggles among classes and class fractions within the hegemonic power and the opportunities and constraints of a given international system.;

DE;"Finance; globalization; states; money; liberalization; capital";
AB;"Many accounts of the globalization of financial markets over the past three decades explain it as a product of unstoppable technological and market forces. This article emphasizes that the behaviour of states was also of central importance in encouraging and permitting the process. States are shown to have supported financial globalization in three ways: (1) granting freedom to market actors through liberalization initiatives; (2) preventing major international financial crises; and (3) choosing not to implement more effective controls on financial movements. These roles are illustrated historically through a description of five sets of episodes since the late 1950s. States are found to have increasingly embraced the globalization trend because of: a competitive deregulation dynamic, political difficulties associated with the implementation of more effective capital controls, the 'hegemonic' interests of the US and Britain, the growing domestic prominence of neoliberal advocates and internationally-oriented corporate interests, and the unusually cooperative nature of central bank interaction.";

TI;Culture as ideology in the conquest of modernity: the historical roots of Japan's regional regulation strategies;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Japan; capitalism; modernity; regulation; history; ideology";
AB;The preoccupation of critical IPE theory with the global neo-liberal programme of deregulation and restructuring tends to hide the emergence of alternative patterns of regulation in different sites of global transformation. Currently, Japanese capitalism projects on a regional plane, concepts of regulation that negate neo-liberal discourse. The contours of the regionalization of Japan's state and economy are taking shape in the form of tightly coordinated production networks, administrative guidance of investment patterns, and a regional division of labour. The paper traces the roots of Japan's regulation strategy for the Asian region to a historical logic of ideological, political and institutional responses of Japanese capitalism to structural change in the world order. At three successive moments in the history of Japanese capitalism, the strategic competence, conscious compromises and 'sense of direction' of administrators played a critical role. It is contended that an account of the history of this intellectual stratum in the process of social differentiation will not only shed light on the persistence of Japan's enigmatic political culture, but also clarify the absence of liberal ideas in Japanese concepts of regulation.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Globalization; externalities; technological learning; conventions; development";
AB;"In a globalizing economy, what are the developmental prospects for middle-income countries, most of which have suffered more than a decade of slow growth or decline? The set of possible development strategies has been radically altered by the restructuring of world markets; the ways in which developing countries must be integrated into the world economy are now very different from those of the period up to the 1970s. In the face of this, the widely different developmental performances of nations are due to a variety of 'local' factors such as technology, institutions, and governmental policies. Thus, potential integration is based on a paradox: the most successful countries and regions have the most 'endogenous' forms of production, not copies of any supposed global 'best practice'. Several aspects of such endogenous approaches must be considered. These range from the traditional subject of the production-oriented development literature, i.e. 'hard' externalities in production systems, to a dimension which is only beginning to recieve serious attention, i.e. 'soft' externalities in development. These include untraded interdependencies in production systems, especially conventions and rules for coordinating complex systems of economic activity. It is argued that the latter explain a large portion of the differences in performance of middle-income countries in the face of global economic forces.";

TI;Capital taxation with open borders;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Profit tax; capital mobility; open economy";
AB;Since 1975, both corporate income tax rates and top marginal income tax rates have been lowered in most OECD countries. A common explanation of this phenomenon is that increased international capital mobility reduced the ability of governments to tax income from capital. In this paper, we examine the constraints on the taxation of income from capital with free capital mobility. We demonstrate that capital mobility increases the constraints on the taxation of income from capital only when investors expect future taxes to rise. As long as taxes are stable, governments using the right tax instruments can collect substantial taxes on uninvested profits without affecting private investment whether capital is mobile or not. We conclude that increased capital mobility is not a compelling explanation of the reduction in tax rates that has occurred in the past fifteen years.;

TI;Bringing capital accumulation back in: the Weapondollar-Petrodollar Coalition-military contractors, oil companies and Middle East 'energy conflicts';
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Capital accumulation; oil; arms exports; multinational corporations; Middle East conflicts; US foreign policy";
AB;This paper offers an alternative approach to the repeated occurrence of Middle East 'energy conflicts'. Our analysis centres around the process of differential capital accumulation, emphasizing the quest to exceed the 'normal rate of return' and to expands one's share in the overall flow of profit. With the evolution of modern capitalism, the dictates of differential accumulation become an ever stronger unifying force, drawing both state managers and corporate executives into increasingly inextricable power-driven alliances.;
;The Middle East drama of oil and arms since the 1970s has been greatly affected by this process. On the one hand, rising nationalism and intensified industry competition during the 1950s and 1960s forced the major oil companies toward a greater cooperation with the OPEC countries. The success of this alliance was contingent on the new atmosphere of 'scarcity' and oil crisis, which was in turn dependent on the progressive militarization of the Middle East. On the other side of the oil-arms equation stood the large US and European-based military contractors which, faced with heightened global competition in civilian markets and limited defence contracts at home, increased their reliance on arms exports to oil-rich countries.;
;Over the past quarter century, the progressive politicization of the oil business, together with the growing commercialization of arms transfers helped shape an uneasy 'Weapondollar-Petrodollar Coalition' between the principal military contractors and petroleum companies. As their environment became intertwined with the broader political realignment of OPEC and the industrial countries, the differential profits of these companies grew evermore dependent on the precarious interaction between rising oil prices and expanding arms exports emanating from successive Middle East 'energy conflicts'. At the same time, these companies were not passive bystanders. This is suggested firstly by the very close correlation existing between their arms deliveries to the Middle East and the region's oil revenues and, secondly, by the fact that every single 'energy conflict' since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War could have been predicted solely by adverse setbacks to the differential profit performance of the large oil companies!;

TI;Competing conceptions of economic regionalism: APEC versus EAEC in the Asia Pacific;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Asia Pacific; APEC; economic regioalism; identity";
AB;Dramatic economic growth in the Asia Pacific has given rise to a both a scholarly and policy oriented debate about the most appropriate organizational form within which any dialogue over the nature economic policy coordination in the region might take place. The most visible exercise in regional economic dialogue over the last few years has been via the evolution of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC). APEC's increasing international profile does not, however, pass uncontested. Some states, and most vocally Malaysia, exhibit a preference for a more 'Asian' and less 'Pacific' form of regional economic dialogue via the putative East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC). This paper examines APEC and the EAEC as exemplars of two competing conceptions of regional economic cooperation. The paper demonstrates that enhanced economic dialogue in the Asia Pacific cannot be understood simply in rationalistic, utility maximizing terms. Questions of politics, culture and identity are also shaping up to be extremely important. The outcome of this contest over how an understanding of 'region' in the Asia Pacific will be constituted over the long term is yet to be determined.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Institutions; globalization; telematics; governance; information and communication technologies; international trade";
AB;This paper examines the relationships within international governance institutions dealing with information-related matters. It focuses on three regimes, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) because telematics services are becoming an international commodity and, as such, 'attract' some form of international governance. The choice of these regimes is derived from a widely-held political assumption that information technology, of which telematics technologies are an elemental component, provides a basis upon which to build, renew or restore economic strength and national advantage. Governments have begun to consider and implement measures that they perceive will best capture the benefits from these technologies. Some of these moves are significantly reflected in the aforementioned regimes.;
;The article considers the effects of telematics through 'institutional instability' that the three regimes are experiencing from the increasing application of telematics to electronically transmit information. It considers 'institutional instability through boundary overlaps of these institutionally and issue-separated international regimes, the effects of which have impinged upon a variety of relationships and categorizations of activities. The effects have also helped to shape and change expectations, challenge accepted rules and create new mechanisms, decision-making rules and procedures.;
;The paper concludes by asserting that there is no indication for, nor suggestion of, the abolition of international governance structures. On the contrary, the increasing membership of some international institutions suggests the utility of collective action. International governance structures will continue to speckle the international political economic topography as appropriate mechanisms through which change is addressed and upon which it is acted.;

DT;Article;
DE;"European integration; globalization; territorial sovereignty; regionalism; 'new medievalism'; 'postmodernity'";
AB;"How is European integration best conceptualized? How and why are relations between regions, states and the European Union changing? This article combines theoretical and empirical analysis of recent developments, especially the partial 'unbundling' of state sovereignty and the growth of sub-state regionalism in response to intensified global competition. It explores the uses and limitations of 'postmodern' and 'new medieval' conceptualizations of territoriality; the possibility that globalization is producing a fundamental shift in the underlying time-space of territorial politics; and the increasing need to differentiate between the various roles of the state, as globalization impacts very unevenly on different policy areas. The European Union has been characterized as the world's 'first truly postmodern international political form' and the empirical analysis confirms significant 'unbundling' of territorial sovereignty. Sub-state regionalism is encouraged by some of the central institutions of the EU and by forces within the regions themselves responding to the Single European Market. However, more ambivalent and contradictory stances are taken by the member states, especially the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland which are among the most centralized and 'antiregionalist'. Supra-state and sub-state developments continue to be crucially conditioned by the power of states; and analogies to the very different circumstances of medieval Europe have to be substantially qualified, not least because the differences are as revealing as the similarities. This perspective helps steer a path between underestimating and exaggerating contemporary changes.";

In this paper we argue that the neo-classical case for free trade is based on inappropriate assumptions; relax these assumptions and the case for non-intervention goes with them.

DE;"NAFTA; hegemony; ideology; liberalism; democracy; globalization";
AB;Mainstream IR/IPE views the world from the perspective of states and statesmen, and accepts uncritically the articulation of modern states with capitalism. In this paper, I adopt a Gramscian perspective from which it becomes possible to interpret the resistance of popular movements - labor unions, environmental and human rights groups, citizen activists, and others - to the transnational liberal agenda of states and multinational capital. I argue that proponents and critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement emphasized different aspects of liberal 'common sense' and envisioned different possible worlds in presenting their cases to the US public. Although they were unable to block Congressional approval of NAFTA in the US, treaty opponents did articulate more explicitly a central tension of liberal capitalism, counterposing the common sense value of 'democracy' to liberalism's traditional valorization of private property and envisioning a transnational political project involving participatory linkages among unionists, activists and citizens across North America. Situating their critique of NAFTA within this tension, they began to make a counter-hegemonic project - organized around the extension and deepening of democracy - more thinkable.;

DE;"International capital markets; credit rationing; open economy macroeconomics; globalization; macroeconomic policy";
AB;This paper provides an alternative to the two prevalent models of the linkage between domestic macroeconomic policy and the international economy in the face of the recent growth of global financial markets. The first, the 'insular' model, suggests that countries retain virtually total control over their economic destinies. The second, the global neo-classical model, suggests that international markets deprive national economies of the instruments needed to pursue active macroeconomic policies. We present an agency-theoretic 'asset balance' model of international capital flows that recognizes that there can be sizeable international capital flows of great significance, but that there are also serious constraints on those flows. The asset balance model is compatible both with the global neo-classical prediction that current accounts do not necessarily equal zero in the long run, and with the insular claim that domestic savings and domestic investment are tightly linked. It is also compatible with a high degree of short-term capital mobility. Our model holds that each country has an equilibrium net of external asset position (debtor or creditor) in relation to its capital stock. Short-run deviations from this asset position induce portfolio adjustments sufficient to restore equilibrium over the medium run (which we estimate as five to seven years). We provide empirical evidence strongly supporting the asset balance model.;

TI;Is the Japanese economy in crisis?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;Although the Japanese economy is often seen as exempt from the crisis, it also has experienced wild business fluctuations and prolonged depressive industrial difficulties since 1973 much in common with other capitalist countries. Beginning from the preceding period of high economic growth, this paper examines the origins and the changing phases of the economic crisis in Japan. Then it analyses the factors for its persistent depression, such as a structural tendency to labour shortage, a competitive pressure by means of ME information technologies, and the difficulties of exporting industries. Despite its seeming strength in appreciated yen, trade surplus, and improved productivity in manufacturing, real wages have been effectively stagnant, and the social position of workers weakened. Economic unevenness has increased in many aspects, while the budget crisis has deepened. Thus, the seeming strength of the Japanese economy is actually coupled with distortion of its structure by exhausted and weakened working people. The paper concludes by discussing Japan's position in the international political economy as well as its recent political change against the background of its economic situation especially for working people.;

TI;The territorial trap: the geographical assumptions of international relations theory;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;Even when political rule is territorial, territoriality does not necessarily entail the practices of total mutual exclusion which dominant understandings of the modern territorial state attribute to it. However, when the territoriality of the state is debated by international relations theorists the discussion is overwhelmingly in terms of the persistence or obsolescence of the territorial state as an unchanging entity rather than in terms of its significance and meaning in different historical-geographical circumstances. Contemporary events call this approach into question. The end of the Cold War, the increased velocity and volatility of the world economy, and the emergence of political movements outside the framework of territorial states, suggest the need to consider the territoriality of states in historical context. Conventional thinking relies on three geographical assumptions - states as fixed units of sovereign space, the domestic/foreign polarity, and states as 'containers' of societies - that have led into the 'territorial trap'.;

TI;Exchange rate politics: contemporary lessons from American history;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
ID;POLICY;
AB;This essay makes two analytical points about the domestic and international politics of exchange rate issues. First, it argues that changes in the political prominence of currency values over time are best explained by changes in the level of international economic integration. The more cross-border trade and investment takes place, the more national macroeconomic policies implicate the exchange rate, and the more exchange rates affect important socioeconomic actors.;
;Second, the article provides a starting point to understand the pattern of domestic political conflict over currency values by analyzing the distributional impact of different currency regimes and levels. Internationally oriented economic groups prefer fixed exchange rates, domestically based groups prefer floating rates. Similarly, tradables producers prefer a relatively depreciated currency, producers of non-tradable goods and services a relatively appreciated one.;
;The arguments are brought to bear on American political conflict over the gold standard in the late 19th and early 20th century. They are then applied to analysis of the ongoing process of European monetary integration.;

TI;International political economy in the age of open Marxism;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;In the last decade or so, transnational historical materialism has fashioned the most ambitious, and perhaps the most politically conscious, expression of critical epistemology in the analysis of global accumulation. It has made an immense contribution to the understanding of the structural power of capital in the world economy, and has been especially important in the analysis of the transnational construction of neo-liberalism, and of the mechanisms by which global imperatives of accumulation have installed themselves as overdetermining principles of political unity.;
;However, though it has claimed the heritage of Gramsci's philosophy of praxis, transnational historical materialism has not seriously addressed questions of political strategy in the world economy, and has not been able to define a political practice adapted to the global social formation that it has defined as its object of analysis.;
;This article proposes both a critical reassessment of the epistemological claims of open Marxism, and an examination of the political strategy it invites.;

TI;Passing judgement: credit rating processes as regulatory mechanisms of governance in the emerging world order;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;This article argues that certain knowledge-producing institutions located in the American financial industry - debt security or bond rating agencies are significant forces in the creation and extension of the new, open global political economy and therefore deserve the attention of international political economists as mechanisms of 'governance without government'. Rating agencies are hypothesized to possess leverage, based on their unique gate-keeping role with regard to investment funds sought by corporations and governments. The article examines trends in capital markets, the processes leading to bond rating judgements, assesses the form and extent of the agencies' governance powers, and contemplates the implications of these judgements for further extension of the global political economy and the form of the emerging world order.;
;Commercial credit is the creation of modern times and belongs in its highest perspective only to the most enlightened and best governed nations. Credit is the vital arm of the system of modern commerce. It has done more - a thousand times more - to enrich nations than all the mines of the world.(1);

TI;Multinational enterprises, political economy and institutional theory: domestic embeddedness in the context of internationalization;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;There is rising interest in placing the study of the multinational enterprise (MNE) at the core of political economy scholarship. This article attempts to locate the MNE in its outer institutional environments. MNEs are embedded in networks of relations with a number of important external actors, not only governments. These networks manifest marked differences between nations and regions, with differential implications for production and managerial arrangements within the firm, public policy choices and the constellation of MNE-government relationships. In the distribution of wealth and power, MNEs are situated at the interface of domestic structures in national and regional political economies, and the process of internationalization within global political economic structures. A research agenda for the 1990s should, therefore, incorporate a political economy of the MNE in structures of global competition and cooperation that have institutional underpinnings. This study seeks to address elements of such an agenda by attempting to overcome the highly artificial distinction between the international and domestic branches of political economy, and selectively making use of the international business literature. It is therefore suggestive of a partial approach (among a number of others) to enhance interdisciplinary research in political economy, making no claim to universal theory on the political economy of the MNE.;

AB;"This paper examines the Lome Convention, an institutional relationship linking the twelve members of the European Community (EC) with sixty-nine countries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP). The immediate aim of the paper is to take stock of the EC-ACP relationship now that Lome has been in effect for nearly two decades and has recently been the subject of extensive renegotiations. More broadly, Lome provides a window on one of the most important processes of the contemporary global system, the growing isolation of large parts of the less developed world from the broader international economy. The paper is divided into three parts. The first describes the major elements of the Lome relationship: preferential access to the EC market for most ACP exports; a compensation scheme for ACP primary product producers who have suffered short-term declines in their export earnings; and a program of development assistance, including both traditional long-term project grants and, more recently, assistance in coping with immediate problems of structural adjustment. The second part examines the convention from a broader perspective, contrasting the liberal institutionalist perspective on international political economy, which emphasizes the importance of building viable international institutions, with the more critical dominance/dependence perspective. Finally, the paper considers the future prospects of the Lome relationship in light of the major changes that have occurred in recent years within the European Community and the global economy as a whole.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;In the early 1980s the United States government was instrumental in entering the issue of liberalization of trade in services, and specifically liberalization of trade in telecommunications services onto the GATT agenda. Yet, in 1992 it reversed its policy and excluded basic telecommunications (voice transmission) from GATT. This article seeks to explain this change in policy, arguing that ten years on, because its activities in other international institutions have effectively allowed it to make the gains it originally sought, the US no longer needs GATT in the telecommunications sector.;

TI;Going lean or going native? The social regulation of 'lean' production systems;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;The experience with Japanese or 'lean' production systems when transplanted to the West has often been below expectations. This article reviews some of this experience and the surrounding debate. Adopting a theoretical position akin to that of the Regulation School, we argue that production systems need to be understood from within the wider sociocultural context in which they have been embedded. We next examine five critical features of the Japanese production system and their modus operandi within Japanese society. We submit that the sociocultural context creates and is reproduced by psychological factors, in particular a concept of self which is arguably different from that which drives the motivations of Western homo economicus. A concluding section explores to what extent, in the West, information technology is accompanied by an organizational function that may replace the role of indigenous social structure in Japanese production systems.;

TI;The evolution of sodoeconomic order in the move to a market economy;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;This paper addresses the problem of the formation of order in sodoeconomic systems in transition. One approach, stemming from interpretations of the writings of Bernard Mandeville and Adam Smith, culminates in modern general equilibrium theory in economics. However, no coherent and adequate formal model of the generation of social order and economic equilibrium has yet been produced on the basis of its atomistic and individualistic assumptions. Furthermore, general equilibrium theory does not deal with economic systems in an adequate sense. It can represent neither true markets, nor money, nor key types of knowledge and uncertainty, nor real time. Finally, it does not support a policy of laissez-faire. In sum, the general equilibrium project now lies in ruins.;
;It is argued here that rather than the interactions of atomistic and self-seeking individuals, real capitalist economies depend on complex relations of loyalty and trust, pervading civil society and its interpersonal relationships. The overcentralized economic systems of the former Eastern Bloc prevented the survival and development of these relations. Clearly, this has important consequences for economic policy in those countries now attempting to build modern capitalist market economies.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;Eastern Europe and Russia, in their struggles to make comprehensive transformations of their economies, are being guided mainly by neoclassical theories and advisors in pursuit of stabilization, privatization, and restructuring. It is the argument of this paper that an alternative approach holds greater promise. The paper offers major tenets and principles of a contemporary institutional-evolutionary theory of institutional adjustment. That framework is then used to present and appraise an abbreviated version of the mainstream position, especially as reflected in the views of advisor Jeffrey Sachs. Of special significance is consideration of social value aspects of institutional adjustment.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;What is the most appropriate framework, the most appropriate economic model, for designing an effective industrial policy? This article examines the evolution of both general policy opinion and economic literature related to this issue. After a brief summary of the tools needed in economics for an appropriate framework of analysis, the first section articulates the latest positions in policy opinion along the spectrum from state interventionism to anti-regulationism. The section then presents the arguments behind the new trade theory and those of complementary theorizations to help us recognize the importance of the new trade theory as a suitable framework in favour of state intervention. The article states, however, that this is not sufficient, and the second section outlines the merits of an emerging systemic approach. It provides insights beyond the scope of the new trade theory which could serve as a foundation for the design of strategic industrial policies in a global industrial system.;

LA;English;

AB;"This article explores conceptual ambiguities and contests involved in the movement from an 'international' to a 'global' economy. It argues that these contests involve, potentially, fundamental transformations in the concept of economic life. After offering an historical interpretation of the concept of the 'economic' in current International Political Economy, the article addresses three sets of conceptual contests raised by the forces of a global capitalist economy: descriptions of the geo-economic map of the world economy; the identity of economic life, especially ambiguities in the relation of public and private life; and descriptions of the spatio-temporal frame of economic life in the world economy. I conclude that the analysis of conceptual transformation and contest suggests a need for reassessing the political theory of the world economy.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;This paper compares the establishment of American assembly plants in Europe during the 1920s and the establishment of Japanese assembly plants in North America during the 1980s. It argues that these were similar in a number of respects, most importantly that the basis of the American advantage of the 1920s and the Japanese advantage of the 1980s was, in fact, the same, namely, a specific social organization of production: Fordism for American companies and 'lean production' for Japanese companies. It is also shown that the same factors which obstructed the dissemination of Fordism in Europe during the 1920s, the resistance of management and labor, have obstructed the dissemination of the Japanese system in North America during the 1980s.

TI;Towards a political economy of food;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;A political economy of food is proposed by drawing critically upon existing literature. First, food is understood in terms of a system of provision in which the connection between production and consumption is viewed as a chain of activities, vertically integrated. Different foods give rise to different systems of provision, and these are distinguished relative to other non-food systems by their heavy dependence upon organic properties throughout the linkages from production to consumption. While emphasis is placed upon the tendencies to vertical (dis) integration along the food chain and to industrialization of food processing and agriculture, these are not interpreted as empirical trends within the confines of given structures, as is standard in the most recent food systems literature, but as potential supports to the reproduction or transformation of those structures. In particular, the structural relationships between agriculture and industry are interpreted as the historically contingent outcome of tendencies and countertendencies associated with capital accumulation. These will vary across food products, undermining the validity of a general theory of the rise and fall of Fordist agriculture.;

TI;Constructing a political economy of food;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;In a new journal devoted to international political economy, the appearance of a paper entitled 'Towards a political economy of food' (Fine, 1994) is cause for celebration and anticipation. Agriculture and, more generally, food do indeed belong in the mainstream of political economy, as the vigour and significance of current debates on the theorization of transitions in modern agro-food systems amply demonstrate. 1 Sadly, despite the promise of its title, Fine's paper fails to meet the challenge of delineating a political economy of food, a potentially rich, and still largely unexplored vein of modern social theory. Instead, we are offered a disappointing and confusing prospectus which combines some elementary strictures on method, a narrow reading of the abundant and diverse literature on agro-food systems, 2 and unsupported claims for an analysis based on systems of provision. Fine's elaboration of this alternative approach to food systems is so rudimentarily elaborated here that informed discussion is precluded.;
;Consequently, in the limited space available, our reply to Fine follows two main lines. First, we respond to his critique of our work on the intersections or 'divides' of agriculture-industry and household-capital, with some attention to questions of method. Second, we comment briefly on the analytical agenda for a political economy of food in late twentieth-century capitalism.;

AB;Agriculture does not develop according to the pattern traced by industry: it follows its own laws. Of this there can be no doubt. . . . This does not mean that the development of agriculture and industry are opposed and irreconcilable. As long as they are regarded as common elements in one overall process, and not existing in mutual isolation, both can be shown to be advancing toward the same end. . . . An investigation of the agrarian question which purports to follow Marx's method cannot simply focus on the question as to whether the smallholder has a future. Rather it has to consider all the changes through which agriculture has passed over the course of the capitalist mode or production: whether, and how, capital is seizing hold of agriculture, revolutionizing it, making old forms of production and property untenable and creating the necessity for new ones. . . . Once we have answered these questions, we can then proceed to see whether Marx's theory is applicable to agriculture or not.;

AB;Dominant perspectives in International Relations start from the assumption that the problem-constellation determines international institutional design. Given the difficulty these ends-oriented approaches face when explaining institutional inefficiencies and pathologies, this article develops an alternate perspective based on anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss's concept of bricolage. Design by bricolage starts from the premise that actors are means-focused, seeking to recombine and redeploy tools from their existing environment. Designers constantly experiment, adapting institutional elements from cognate fields, with the aim of creating novel institutional arrangements. The outcomes of international cooperation are a function of the design process, more than the initial problem type. To illustrate the usefulness of this perspective, the paper examines the evolution of the International Financial Architecture, with a focus on the evolution of the international securities regime. A design by bricolage perspective is well positioned to make sense of enduring International Relations puzzles such as why second-best solutions often persist yet later succeed, and, importantly, re-opens the conversation on agency in international institutional design that has been downplayed by conventional, structural approaches. The design of international institutional elements is frequently experimental where form trumps function.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS; CREDIT RATING AGENCIES; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; BANKING; UNCERTAINTY; GOVERNANCE; CRISIS; RISK";
AB;Financial firms' valuation approaches are key to financial market functioning. The financial crisis exposed fundamental faults in pre-crisis practices and the regulations that bolstered them. Critics pointed to reflexivity: financial markets have no solid anchor outside of market participants' assessments, which makes them inherently unstable. Reflexivity implies valuation techniques are performative: they shape rather than reflect risks. Critics thus called for root and branch reform: regulators needed to regain control over these valuation practices. In spite of a flurry of changes, progress on the reforms has been limited in precisely those domains where it seemed most necessary. We argue that this lack of progress does not persist in spite of market reflexivity, but because of it. Public prescriptiveness might mandate widespread use of deficient valuation routines, exacerbating their deleterious performative effects and implicating public authorities in future financial crises. In the regulator's conundrum, neither a hands-off approach to valuation approaches, nor an interventionist stance promises to be effective. Empirically, we show how reflexivity has obstructed fundamental reforms in the European Union in three key domains: credit ratings, liquidity regulation, and accounting standards. Market reflexivity itself is, therefore, crucial to understanding the limited regulatory reforms we have witnessed since the crisis.;

DT;Article;
DE;"China; North Korea; sanctions; trade; border economy; financial regulation";
ID;"TARGETED SANCTIONS; CHINA; WORK";
AB;This article critically engages with recent arguments that financial sanctions are capable of overcoming the shortcomings of traditional trade sanctions as well as more targeted smart sanctions.' Much of the existing analysis of financial sanctions cites as evidence of their success the case of the US Treasury's 2005 accusations against Macao's Banco Delta Asia of facilitating North Korean money laundering. We argue, however, that analysis of the broader impact of financial sanctions on North Korea's principle bilateral economic relationship, namely the Sino-North Korean border economy, reveals that such measures have merely served to increase the scope of evasive economic activity. In particular, financial sanctions have meant that methods of trade settlement in the border economy are based primarily on cash and barter, with minimal recourse to the official banking system. This raises questions not only regarding the effectiveness of financial sanctions but also the degree to which they serve to provoke counter-responses that actively undermine the broader objectives pursued by sender states. Through examining the case of Sino-North Korean border economy, this article contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the shortcomings of financial sanctions as a tool of foreign policy.;

AB;Under what conditions are foreign aid donors willing to suspend foreign aid to punish political transgressions, such as election fraud, corruption scandals or political repression? Prior scholarship has emphasized that political sanctions, including foreign aid suspensions, are constrained by the geostrategic considerations of donor countries. However, foreign aid suspensions often occur in strategically important countries, and donors respond differently to different types of political transgressions within the same county. To shed light on this puzzle, in this article, I present evidence from an original survey of top-level donor representatives in 20 African countries, including a list experiment designed to elicit truthful responses about the conditions under which donors are willing to suspend foreign aid. I argue that the likelihood of a foreign aid suspension depends not only on the strategic considerations of the donor government, but also on the institutional incentives of the donor agency. A donor agency's institutional incentives are shaped by the agency's organizational design, as well as by its foreign aid portfolio in the recipient country.;

TI;Accumulating through food crisis? Farmers, commodity traders and the distributional politics of financialization;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
DE;"Financialization; derivatives regulation; food regimes; food crisis; commodity trading; agriculture";
ID;"FINANCE; POWER; FUTURES; RIOTS";
AB;This paper considers the domestic and international ramifications of financialization and grain price instability in the US agri-food sector. It finds that during the recent period of high and volatile prices, the average income of large-scale farms reached the earnings threshold of the top percentile of US households, and agricultural commodity traders markedly outperformed other corporate groups. In contrast, small-scale farms, particularly those involved in cattle and wheat production, have struggled to manage the uncertainty brought by price tumult. The paper goes on to examine the role that these uneven distributional dynamics play in debates around how hedging and speculation should be defined and regulated in the wake of the food crisis of 2007-08. It shows that a coalition of small-scale farmers has actively pushed for a far-reaching definition of speculation and concomitantly wide-ranging curbs on what they deem to be speculative activity. Conversely, the major commodity traders and a plurality of organizations representing large-scale grain producers have called for a narrower interpretation of speculation which leaves the extant regulatory regime largely in place. With these insights, I suggest that financialization and associated price volatility tend to reinforce inequality in rural America while possibly exacerbating social instability and hardship abroad.;

AB;The concept of domestic veto players has become a popular explanation for foreign policy rigidity. We argue that veto players can be amenable to new policy initiatives - in our case preferential trade agreements (PTAs) - but then choose to exert a strong influence on their contents. Drawing upon more than a dozen PTA-design variables for an expanded collection of postwar trade agreements, our quantitative tests reveal that veto players systematically shape what is included in, and excluded from, PTAs. Most notably, agreements concluded under greater veto-player constraints contain fewer liberalization commitments, weaker dispute settlement, and more opt-outs in the form of trade remedies. Our findings highlight domestic political actors as important determinants of international institutional design and show that veto players exert additional, and perhaps stronger, influence on what is proscribed in agreements, not just whether they are enacted in the first place.;

AB;On 23 June 2016, a majority of 52% of British voters decided in a referendum that the United Kingdom should leave the European Union. The decision sent shockwaves around Britain, Europe, and the world: the Brexit'-vote presents the first instance that a country has voted to exit a major supranational institution, putting both the European integration project and the future of the United Kingdom in a globalized world into question. At the time of writing, four months after the referendum vote, the contours of Brexit remain unclear. Yet even within this short time frame, Brexit politics have been remarkable on both the domestic and the international level. In this paper, we first present a brief overview of IPE research in the open economy politics (OEP) tradition. We then discuss the insights OEP provides that help us to better understand the referendum vote and Brexit politics, but also emphasize that they present a number of puzzles for OEP-inspired researchers. Based on this analysis, the final section suggests avenues for advancing the OEP research program.;

AB;Britain's BREXIT vote and Trump's victory in the US presidential elections sent shockwaves through the Western liberal establishment, including academia. Both events suggest yet another rethinking' of International Political Economy (IPE). Yet we have been here before. After the global financial crisis of 2008, Open Economy Politics' (OEP) was criticized for being unable to either anticipate or adequately explain the global financial crisis. Now that IPE has been caught short twice in a decade, any rethinking must go beyond critique and beyond OEP. To stop being surprised, we argue that IPE needs to shift its focus from micro-foundations back to macro-effects. IPE today strangely lacks an appreciation for the global macroeconomics that drives the outcomes it has such difficulty explaining, such as recurring financial bubbles, increasing levels of inequality, and the global rise of populism. Bringing the global macroeconomy back into the IPE, we argue, is a necessary corrective.;

AB;In the wake of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, scholars of international affairs have a chance to reflect on what this unanticipated event means for global politics. Many scholars have started applying standard political economy models based on the distributional consequences of trade or the sociotropic sources of individual policy positions to understand voter preferences. In this essay, we move the conversation using the lever of the New Interdependence Approach to reflect on the referendum process more generally. Rather than viewing globalization largely as an exogenous shock that is filtered through national institutions and cleavages, we argue that it has the potential to alter the political issue space as well as the institutional opportunities available to political actors. In conclusion, we push scholars of both comparative politics and international relations to develop a research agenda for electoral politics in an age of interdependence.;

AB;Adding discursive institutionalism to the political science toolkit is key to understanding the victory of the forces pushing the UK to exit from the EU and for Trump's election in the US. The contextualized analysis of the substantive content of agents' ideas enables us to explore the ideational root causes of discontent, including economic neo-liberalism, social liberalism, and political mistrust. The examination of the discursive dynamics of policy coordination and political communication calls attention to agents' rhetorical strategies, the circulation of ideas in discursive communities, and the role of ideational leaders along with that of the public and the media in a post-truth era. Discursive institutionalism also lends insight into questions of power, including how ideational agents have been able to use their persuasive power through ideas to channel people's anger while challenging experts' power over ideas as they upended the long-standing power in ideas of the liberal order.;

ID;"ECONOMY; RISE";
AB;Brexit' was a watershed moment. It has made visible the major faultlines and fissures that underlie the so-called United Kingdom' (UK) and our increasingly globalized world. But the precise nature of those faultlines and fissures requires multiple strands of critical analysis and interpretation. To date, most analyses have highlighted the socio-economic class and immigration or rather race/empire reasons for the Brexit vote neglecting their gendered dimensions. Building on the framework developed in Scandalous Economics we show how gendered analysis both illuminates and complicates dominant explanations of the Brexit vote. We interrogate the agents of Brexit - highlighting the paradox of men's dominance of the Brexit campaign and women's rise in the political crisis that ensued after the referendum vote. We also examine the intersectional inequalities that have made Brexit conceivable from a gender perspective, and its likely impact given the austerity policies and global chains of migrant labour upon which the UK economy depends. We conclude that critical feminist political economy broadens as well as globalizes our analysis of international political economy. Moreover, this analysis of Brexit is a lens which can be used to interrogate the spread of populism aka Trumpism' elsewhere.;

AB;We analyze the organizational logics of how social clustering operates within International Political Economy (IPE). Using a variety of new data on IPE publishing, teaching, and conference attendance, we use network analysis and community detection to understand social clustering within the field. We find that when it comes to publishing and intellectual engagement, IPE is highly pluralistic and driven by a logic of niche proliferation'. Teaching IPE, however, is characterized by a reduction to polarity' that emphasizes a dualism in ontological and epistemological frames. In the face of competitive exclusion pressures, intellectual communities regenerate themselves by constructing niches while simultaneously nodding to a common tradition.;

ID;"LATIN-AMERICA; NEO-DEVELOPMENTALISM; WASHINGTON CONSENSUS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CAPITALISM; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; CHILE";
AB;This article provides an analysis of the uneven practices and outcomes of new developmentalism in Brazil. New developmentalism has been described as a hybrid approach to development. It combines liberal practices of privatization and export orientation with state intervention to achieve social inclusion and economic development. Academic and policy literatures have repeatedly debated the conditions under which development takes place and have particularly focused on the role of the state. So far, discussions have predominantly concentrated on economic developments. We focus on the trajectories of new developmentalism in three strategic sectors in the Brazilian economy: oil, mining and steel, with particular emphasis on the steel industry. We contribute to the debate by paying equal attention to economic and social outcomes in these three sectors. We conclude that new developmentalism is sectorally specific. In the extractive sectors, export competitiveness translates into high wages. In steel, in contrast, new developmentalism brings economic benefits to some but social benefits to few. Thus, it is a paradigm of development but it is not wholly developmental.;

AB;This article offers a theoretical framework to explain how Global Wealth Chains (GWCs) are created, maintained, and governed. We draw upon different strands of literature, including scholarship in International Political Economy and Economic Geography on Global Value Chains, literature on finance and law in Institutional Economics, and work from Economic Sociology on network dynamics within markets. This scholarship assists us in highlighting three variables in how GWCs are articulated and change according to: (1) the complexity of transactions, (2) regulatory liability, and (3) innovation capacities among suppliers of products used in wealth chains. We then differentiate five types of GWC governance - Market, Modular, Relational, Captive, and Hierarchy - which range from simple 'off shelf' products shielded from regulators by advantageous international tax laws to highly complex and flexible innovative financial products produced by large financial institutions and corporations. This article highlights how GWCs intersect with value chains, and provides brief case examples of wealth chains and how they interact.;

TI;Illicit Global Wealth Chains after the financial crisis: micro-states and an unusual suspect;

DT;Article;
DE;"Global Wealth Chains; corruption; tax evasion; micro-states; illicit financial flows; Australia";
AB;Since the financial crisis, various supra-national initiatives have targeted banking and corporate secrecy, the conventional underpinnings of the illicit Global Wealth Chains through which money from tax evasion, corruption and other financial offences are passed across borders. This paper analyses the varying impact of these initiatives on the diverse types of Wealth Chains running through two stereotypical havens, Liechtenstein and the Seychelles, and one G20/OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) member rarely associated with illicit financial flows, Australia. Recent campaigns have had a significant impact on illicit Global Wealth Chains connected to micro-state tax havens, while leaving those to Australia unaffected. Even with reference to the micro-state havens, however, outside regulatory shifts have in some cases changed the flow or form of Wealth Chains by unintentionally creating new opportunities for offshore finance. Evidence is drawn from interviews and fieldwork in all three countries, secretly recorded footage of intermediaries explaining the workings of illicit Wealth Chains, and corporate and property records collected by a private investigator engaged by the author.;

AB;The rise of intangible assets such as brand names, research and development, patents and other forms of abstract capital such as digital platforms and data flows has confounded extant measures and concepts of capital and accumulation. What used to be a residual asset category known as 'goodwill' has now overtaken so-called fixed or tangible assets in the profitability and valuation of many leading corporations. Yet these intangible assets lead a double life as both spatial and temporal in some dimensions, yet fluid and spatio-temporally elusive in others. Using a framework focused on measuring (by accountants), managing (by corporations) and monitoring (by International Political Economy scholars and regulators), this article explores the longer term implications of accumulation of internationalised capital in intangible and abstract forms, and the prominent role of finance and offshore in giving mobility and fluidity to these forms of capital. The article suggests that while global value chain and global production network analyses have helped researchers and policy-makers to track increasingly fragmented and fluid networks of commodity production, there also is a need to follow the global double life of internationalised and financialised intangible assets and wealth flows, and parallel reorganisations of state forms in response to those transformations.;

AB;In 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain tobacco packaging in an effort to reduce tobacco consumption. This move was vehemently opposed by the tobacco industry, which challenged it on several levels: nationally, bilaterally and multilaterally at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The political behaviour of the tobacco companies in this case is puzzling both in terms of scale, operating at multiple levels at the same time, and in terms of the countries mobilized in their defence. WTO litigation is typically the result of multinational enterprises (MNEs) lobbying their own government, but here third countries were mobilized. Lobbying in third country contexts, with the objective of accessing multilateral dispute settlement systems, has been little studied. We thus know very little about the driving factors behind such activities, how target governments are selected and what lobbying strategies are used. This article draws on emerging research on transnational lobbying and a case study of the plain packaging case to explore these issues in detail and, by doing so, aims to further our theoretical understanding of the political economy of international trade in the context of increasing regime complexity and globalization of production. In addition, the article sheds new light on advocacy in the context of disputes about cross-border challenges to domestic regulation.;

AB;This article examines how Chinese National Oil Companies (NOCs) make location decisions regarding investments in overseas oil and gas. We argue that these location decisions are determined by the allocation of risk between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and high-level politics. As such, the investment decisions made by NOCs change over time and according to who bears the risk of the investment: the firm or the state. An econometric analysis based on a novel data-set of Chinese NOCs' OFDI over a 14-year period supports this argument. Our findings challenge existing notions of Chinese exceptionalism: rather than making 'risk perverse' location decisions, we find that NOCs seek out host states with robust provisions for the rule of law, control over corruption, and that have a history of stability over the long run.;

DE;"capital markets; institutional change; Chinese party-state; global financial crisis; state capitalism; financial globalisation";
ID;"CAPITALISM; VARIETIES";
AB;This paper is the first to investigate the changes in criteria for market access under China's Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) Programmes. By combining insights on institutional change and Chinese elite politics, it demonstrates that the evolution of access criteria can be explained by interdependent bargaining between Chinese party leaders, administrative authorities and corporate interests. The 2008 global financial crisis triggered fundamental shifts in resource interdependencies that altered the bargaining dynamics between these agents. The changes in internal and external conditions are decisive for understanding how the QFII programmes evolved. The analysis draws on an original data-set coupling 91 multi-stakeholder interviews, database analysis and internal government records. The findings show that institutional change in China's cross-border investment programmes is a negotiated economic outcome bridging interdependent state and market agents. These results have important implications for the study of globalisation and institutional change in non-Western contexts. They challenge existing narratives of an all-pervasive Chinese party-state that is resistant to change.;

AB;Mainstream approaches to international political economy seek to explain the political transformations that have made more open trade relations possible. They stress how changing coalitions of interest groups within particular states and changing functional needs of states give rise to new international agreements. While these approaches remain valuable, they only imperfectly encompass a new set of important causal relations. We now live in the world that trade built - a world where greater interdependence has major consequences both for actors' interests and their ability to pursue those interests. A new body of work, which we have called the 'new interdependence' explains how these transformations are playing out. The new interdependence stresses a structural vision of international politics based on rule overlap between different national jurisdictions, which leads to clashes over whose rules should apply when. This not only generates tensions, but also opportunity structures that may help actors to better shape potential solutions to these clashes. However, some actors will have greater access to these opportunity structures, and hence greater influence and bargaining strength - than others. These three factors - rule overlap, opportunity structures and power asymmetries - provide the basis for a compelling understanding of international politics.;

AB;"International bureaucrats employed in inter-governmental organizations (IGOs) have a stake in the solidification and expansion of traditional global governance structures. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often are thought to be threats to IGOs. But international bureaucracies regularly seek cooperation with NGOs that can help in cross-national layering': the creation of formal or informal international institutions that overlay domestic institutions, seeking to replace or subsume them over time. This article develops a 4Cs taxonomy' in which shared/unshared resource bases and shared/unshared values translate into cooperative, co-optative, competitive, or conflictual relations between NGOs and international bureaucracies. It then examines the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) over a 70-year period, showing how different mixes of resources and values help to explain why FAO bureaucrats have cycled through different relationships with NGOs. This exemplifies themes of the New Interdependence Approach: (1) the forces of globalization and interdependence create openings for transnational alliances among non-state actors; (2) continued globalization takes place not in a state of anarchy, but in an environment of overlapping responsibilities or principles; and (3) institutions go beyond being rules of the game' and can be drivers of power shifts in domestic and international affairs.";

ID;"HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; REGULATORY CAPTURE; GOVERNANCE; POWER; MARKETS; STATE; AMERICA; POLICY; ARRANGEMENTS; ORGANIZATION";
AB;International soft law has become a hallmark of global economic governance: networks of official and private governors' create standards, best practices and norms. Research often frames these efforts as solutions to perceived problems arising from globalization. Yet the narrow focus on the rulemaking process - coordination, distributive implications and implementation - misses second-order political repercussions. Giving special attention to the interaction between international soft law and the political landscape of business advocacy, this article offers an alternative account of the relationship between transnational rules and powerful actors. We argue that transnational informal institutions are not only sites of cooperation that resolve the economic policy concerns of the day, but are also sources of policy feedback that can transform the political landscape. To illustrate the potential empirical traction of these arguments, we examine the critical case of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Institute of International Finance (IIF). The IIF went from being a struggling organization with no regulatory agenda or lobbying skills to the world's most influential financial industry advocate directly engaging transnational forums. We find that second-order effects of soft law were a primary cause of the IIF's transformation. Our study has major implications for research on global governance as we highlight the political ramifications and temporal effects of informal institutions for business representation.;

ID;"HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; REGIME COMPLEX; CRISIS; POLITICS; STATE";
AB;The paper sets out to explain why the European Central Bank and the European Commission relaxed their opposition to debt restructuring and fiscal accommodation for Greece in the shift from the first to second adjustment program. Using the findings of the empirical analysis, the paper shows that EU institutions' repositioning cannot easily be ascribed to the mechanisms that are typically at play in international negotiations, namely exogenous pressures and internalization of new beliefs through persuasion. Instead, the paper argues that a more nuanced and complete explanation of the relaxation of opposition to the change in the program strategy requires taking into account the institutional and temporal dimensions of the Troika negotiations. Specifically, the paper shows that the evolution of European actors' preferences was shaped by the layering of new crisis management rules into the machinery of the monetary union. Layering allowed political actors in favor of the status quo achieving their preferences under changed external circumstances.;

DE;"interdependence; governance; NGO; multinational corporation";
AB;Existing models that aim to explain the effects of economic interdependence on global politics do not adequately capture transnational politics and the production of new modes of governance. The new interdependence approach (NIA), defined and illustrated in this symposium, exemplifies new modes of cross-border complex governance. Complex governance is defined by its disruption of the dominant role of national governments in global and regional governance. National governments have become only one set of actors in among a heterogeneous group of participants in global governance, agents who collaborate across type to produce more informal and less legalized governance outcomes. Complex governance and the NIA approach appear to have both functional limits (more apparent in issue-areas new to the global agenda) and spatial limits (gradually extending beyond the industrialized countries to the developing world). National governments and politics remain influential in a world of complex governance. A final contribution of the NIA approach is its concentration on the distributional effects of complex governance.;

AB;Human rights, labour standards, and environmental protection standards are commonly linked to trade. Because these links come in different forms, the question arises: what accounts for such variation? An examination of the wide variety of non-trade issues (NTIs) in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) reveals that prominent explanations fall short of explaining this variation. I argue that domestic characteristics of trade partner countries trigger lobbying by interest groups and cause design changes. I hypothesize that strong import and wage pressure increases lobbying by social and environmental protection advocates. A large difference between member states regarding civil and political rights protection levels should trigger NGO activity, but only if at least one member complies at a very high level already. In order to test the argument, I rely on a novel dataset including newly coded data on NTIs design for 474 PTAs signed between 1990 and January 2016. The findings using multivariate regression analysis show that linking trade and social or environmental clauses is motivated by strategic and the inclusion of political rights by substantial interests. This study contributes to the literature on rational design of international institutions, legalization, and issue-linkage.;

TI;Ratcheting up protective regulations in the shadow of the WTO: NGO strategy and food safety standard-setting in India;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DT;Article;
DE;"World Trade Organization; food safety; domestic regulation; precautionary principle; India; institutional power";
ID;"GOVERNANCE; SCIENCE";
AB;How does the World Trade Organization (WTO) shape contests among civil society organizations, transnational firms, and states over domestic regulations that protect human health, such as food safety standards? The WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS Agreement) aims to limit the use of non-tariff barriers like regulatory standards as protectionist measures. Yet, few attempts have been made to explore how these rules shape national policy-making processes, and particularly the ability of civil society organizations to ratchet up protective regulations. Through a study of standard-setting for pesticide residues in soft drinks in India, I argue that WTO rules are at once legal obligations backed by the coercive threat of economic sanctions and discursive standards for what constitutes appropriate regulatory practice.' As discursive standards, the rules shape the rationalities and strategies of diverse actors in domestic regulatory contests. These standards of appropriate regulatory practice are used instrumentally by transnational firms to undermine the influence of civil society in policy-making but can also offer opportunities for civil society organizations to contest and even enlarge the boundaries of appropriate regulatory practice.;

AB;In recent years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has re-emerged as a central actor in global economic governance. Its rhetoric and policies suggest that the organization has radically changed the ways in which it offers financial assistance to countries in economic trouble. We revisit two long-standing controversies: Has the policy content of IMF programmes evolved to allow for more policy space? Do these programmes now allow for the protection of labour and social policies? We collected relevant archival material on the IMF's lending operations and identified all policy conditionality in IMF loan agreements between 1985 and 2014, extracting 55,465 individual conditions across 131 countries in total. We find little evidence of a fundamental transformation of IMF conditionality. The organization's post-2008 programmes reincorporated many of the mandated reforms that the organization claims to no longer advocate and the number of conditions has been increasing. We also find that policies introduced to ameliorate the social consequences of IMF macroeconomic advice have been inadequately incorporated into programme design. Drawing on this evidence, we argue that multiple layers of rhetoric and ceremonial reforms have been designed to obscure the actual practice of adjustment programmes, revealing an escalating commitment to hypocrisy.;

AB;We address the impact on international monetary power of the size and nature of the US's international financial assets and liabilities. Financial globalization makes critical a focus on a nation's international financial assets and liabilities, its external balance sheet'. We suggest an expansion of Cohen's existing framework of international monetary power to include the implications of valuation changes in these external balance sheets, focusing on sources of valuation, sensitivity and vulnerability of the US economy to these changes and implications for US ability to use monetary statecraft. By focusing on developments since 2007 and on events over the financial crisis period, we show that the increased size and nature of the US's external balance sheet has reduced US autonomy and monetary power. Underpinning the changes in the US's external balance sheet are activities of private financial market actors whose influence in international monetary affairs has grown markedly.;

ID;"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; BITS; AID; DIFFUSION; REGIME; PROTECTION; AGREEMENTS; POLICY";
AB;The United States has signed 47 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) over the last three decades. The standard explanation for why the United States' government signed those BITs is that it was motivated by a desire to promote the development of international investment law and to protect American capital invested abroad. An alternative explanation, however, is that the United States has largely used BITs as a foreign policy tool to improve relationships with strategically important countries in the developing world. This project uses qualitative and quantitative evidence to assess whether the United States was motivated to sign BITs based on investment considerations or political considerations. The qualitative evidence suggests that US executive branch officials viewed BITs as a potential way to cement and strengthen relationships with politically important countries. The quantitative evidence suggests that proxies for investment considerations - like trade and FDI flows - are weak predictors of US BIT formation, but that political considerations - like military aid and whether a country was formerly a communist state - are consistently statistically significant predictors. Taken together, the evidence supports the argument that political considerations are better predictors of the BITs the United States signed than investment considerations.;

ID;"FOREIGN-AID; DEPENDENCY; REFORM; TRADE; WORLD; GLOBALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; INTERESTS; COUNTRIES; POLICIES";
AB;Globalization scholars have long-debated to what extent economic integration, and, specifically, mobile private capital, constrains national policy-making. With Western capital reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, state-owned capital made inroads globally. China, as the world's largest saver, expanded its cross-border lending, funneling almost US$300 billion to developing countries since the crisis. What are the implications for debtor governments' room to maneuver? I contend that China's state-led capitalism is an important form of patient capital, characterized by a longer term horizon. I argue that its rapid global expansion has transformed the traditional relationship between economic interdependence and national policy autonomy. Without the market's threat of short-term capital withdrawal, national governments have considerably more room to maneuver. Given the recent emergence of Chinese financing, I employ a comparative case study analysis of two of China's largest debtors - Brazil and Venezuela - before and after the introduction of Chinese credit. I find that government budget deficits increase as Chinese state-to-state financing accounts for a larger share of total external public financing. These findings offer important new insights for the study of globalization, Latin American development, and China-Latin American relations, by helping explain the conditions under which nations veer from Western governance models.;

AB;Why are industries highly active in some battles over international trade policies, but in other instances, individual firms are highly active and industry groups are subdued? I argue that rising intra-industry trade in the postwar period has undermined traditional trade coalitions and created new opportunities for individual firms to become politically active. Drawing on new trade theories from economics, as well as work on firm heterogeneity and lobbying, I argue that industry associations become less active as intra-industry trade increases due to competing trade preferences among member firms. At the same time, individual firms become more politically active. My results suggest that firms lobby not only for protection, but liberalization. Using data on lobbying expenditures in the USA, my work takes recent analyses of intra-industry trade and lobbying a step further. I show how intra-industry trade redraws domestic political alignments and changes the composition of societal coalitions organized to influence trade policy.;

ID;"BARRIERS; ECONOMY";
AB;The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations aspire to create the world's most ambitious trade agreement between the world's two largest economies. The politics associated with TTIP are different from those associated with previous trade negotiations. Moreover, they diverge from the prevailing International Political Economy (IPE) account of trade policy. The politics of TTIP diverge from the conventional IPE account of trade politics in two particularly noteworthy ways. First, rather than being rivals, American and European business interests are allies, adopting common positions on what they want the agreement to look like. Second, opposition within both the USA and the EU comes not primarily from firms and workers fearing increased economic competition, but from less traditional trade actors - consumer and environmental groups and citizens - concerned about the erosion of valued regulations. I argue that the unusual politics is the product of two distinct, but related factors. The first is the extraordinary level of cross-investment between the two economies. The second concerns the unique emphasis on addressing non-tariff barriers, particularly regulatory differences, and the significance of the negotiating partner. I test the plausibility of these arguments through within-case variation and by preliminary comparison to other contemporary negotiations of deep' preferential trade agreements.;

ID;"LIBERALIZATION; PREFERENCES; INTERESTS";
AB;East Asian countries have implemented around 60 free trade agreements (FTAs), mostly bilateral, to become one of the most active sites of regionalism. The dominant analyses portray these FTAs as driven primarily by foreign policy motivations and promoted by political leaders with businesses marginally involved or interested. It is contended here that, compared to other forms of liberalization, bilateral FTA negotiations promote new institutional arrangements within government agencies and business associations and unique configurations of government-business relations. Formulation of FTAs imposes greater information demands on government officials, which should compel them to consult business associations. In turn, clearer identification of FTAs' impacts and greater chances to affect their formulation should increase business incentives to lobby for or against FTA liberalization domestically and across borders. Demands on officials and business associations upon successive FTAs should foster institutional change/creation to reduce information and coordination costs. These hypotheses were tested on the bilateral FTAs of Thailand and Malaysia. FTAs in these countries stimulated government-business consultations and lobbying by businesses that, for some key FTAs, took the initiative. Successive negotiations strengthened the technical capacities of officials and business associations and stimulated the emergence of new institutions, which may endure to provide similar functions for multilateral rounds.;

AB;This paper investigates why some developing countries maintain weak and undervalued exchange rates while others do not. I argue that one key feature of the developmental state' - namely, state control over the financial system - contributes to an undervalued exchange rate. However, state control of finance promotes undervaluation under a narrower set of conditions than most developmental state theories suggest. State-owned banks increase support for exchange rate undervaluation from certain interest groups. When those interest groups are politically important, state-owned banks encourage policymakers to undervalue their exchange rates. Two sets of empirical analyses support the argument. Using time-series - cross-sectional data, I show that state-owned banks are associated with undervalued exchange rates, but only in developing countries with large manufacturing sectors. Second, analyses of firm-level survey data reveal that state-owned banks increase the manufacturing sector's support for an undervalued exchange rate. These findings suggest that state institutions influence exchange rate policy, though their effects are contingent upon the configuration of interests in society.;

AB;The legal implementation of internationally agreed norms on a domestic level gives momentum to a substantial reinterpretation. Based on this insight, this article develops an ideal-typology of possible localization' outcomes. Apart from a literal adoption of an international norm, we show that the domestic implementation may change its emphasis (accentuation), amend it by supplementary purposes (addition), or imply a deviation which nevertheless sticks to the letter of the international wording (subversion). We argue that the specific form of localization depends on the interaction between international pressure politics and its congruence with the prevailing domestic public and private preferences. International power constellations explain why an international norm is implemented, but the specific character of its localization is mainly determined by domestic actor constellations. To substantiate our claims, we analyze the implementation of two interconnected international agreements in India and Brazil. While both the Convention on Biodiversity and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights introduce the norm of property rights for intellectual knowledge in previously (at least internationally) unregulated fields, the particular characteristics of their respective implementation in both countries display the interaction between international pressure and domestic preferences in our four case studies.;

AB;This paper presents the main features of the financialisation of the Portuguese economy and society by focusing on the relation between the Portuguese financial sector and both external and domestic economic agents. It underlines the role played by the insertion of domestic finance into international financial markets in the financialisation of the country. Based on the Portuguese case, it elaborates on the theoretical understanding of the context-specific nature of semi-peripheral financialisation aimed as a contribution to an emerging body of literature addressing this phase of capitalism.;

AB;Tax cooperation puts offshore centers worse off, as their compensation for forgone profits is a hard political sell, and unlikely to produce the same spillover effects on wages and employment as the attraction of foreign tax base. Coercion by a great power thus seems to be a prerequisite for successful international cooperation in tax matters. Great power status is based on internal market size. Governments become substantially more likely to use this power through sanction threats against tax havens when two factors coincide: (1) domestic constraints preventing a shift of the tax burden to labor and consumption and (2) scope for redistributive cooperation benefitting great power banks or multinationals. Hypotheses are tested in an analysis of tax negotiations at OECD level between 1996 and 2014.;

AB;"Concomitant with globalization, neoliberal tax reforms have spread across the globe since the early 1980s. In many countries, statutory rates, the number of tax brackets, and the incidence of tax allowances have been reduced for income taxes; in the developing world, international liberalization has also been associated with reduced revenues from trade taxes and increased pressures for expansion of the value added tax and income tax revenue intake. Yet, competition for mobile assets and new opportunities for tax avoidance potentially constrains taxation of corporate and personal income. Thus, contemporary conditions create especially severe challenges for the pursuit of greater income equality and enhanced public goods provision in developing nations. The present paper situates this special issue's contributions within the theoretical and empirical literatures that seek to explain contemporary changes in taxation. I argue that we know quite a lot about the tax effects of globalization, domestic politics, and their interaction in rich democracies; we know much less about how international forces and domestic factors influence tax reforms in the developing world. In this context, I highlight how each paper in this volume contributes to our understanding of the impacts of globalization and domestic politics on tax policy choices and, in turn, the challenges and opportunities for revenue mobilization in developing nations.";

AB;For a long time, governments relied heavily on trade taxes as the main source of public finance, and for some countries, mainly less developed ones, they still account for a large share of revenue. Yet, with trade liberalization, governments have been forced to abandon these easy-to-collect taxes and to adopt modern hard-to-collect taxes, mainly internal income and consumption taxes. Surprisingly, we know little about how governments across the world have addressed this common challenge. In this paper, we analyze the rise of the most important present taxes: the personal and corporate income tax, the general sales tax and the value-added tax. Based on a self-coded dataset, we provide a historical-descriptive outline of the expansion of modern taxes since 1842 and test the effect of trade liberalization on the probability to adopt hard(er)-to-collect taxes. While trade is an important determinant for the legislation of modern taxes, we find that its influence is not universal but depends on the tax type. Only the personal income tax and the value-added tax have served as a revenue substitution to trade taxes, while the general sales tax and the corporate income tax were rather fueled by other factors such as spending pressures.;

AB;Many developing countries use tax incentives to attract foreign direct investment, sacrificing immediate revenue from foreign capital, even though the effects of tax incentives on investment, growth, and revenue are empirically dubious. This leads to the puzzle of why states adopt tax incentives. Extant studies of tax incentive adoption overlook the fact that many countries have decentralized fiscal authority, allowing subnational governments to offer tax incentives. Public finance scholars argue that fiscal federalism intensifies tax competition among regions. Hence, drawing on the public finance scholarship, one may ask: Does fiscal decentralization lead to a race to the top among subnational governments and an oversupply of tax incentives in a country? This article argues that fiscal decentralization affects tax incentives in complex ways. When subnational governments are authorized to set tax policies, their politicians have economic and political incentives to engage in tax competition for mobile capital, providing more tax incentives in a country. However, the politicians are less likely to do so if they are held accountable and have to fund most expenditures through own-source tax revenues. An empirical analysis of over 50 developing countries in early 2000s produces robust supporting evidence. This research challenges both the view that fiscal decentralization is always beneficial and the view that horizontal competition invariably produces inefficiently low tax rates. The impact of fiscal decentralization on tax incentives and by implication, revenue mobilization depends on the design of the central-local government relations.;

AB;Developing countries are being confronted with severe fiscal challenges in the global economy. Over the last two decades, governments have been accepting significant reductions in trade taxes to support trade liberalization. This is particularly problematic for developing economies because trade taxes have been a key source of government revenues. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which international financial institutions (IFIs) successfully assist developing countries with recovering the lost revenue from trade liberalization by implementing various domestic tax reforms. We argue that regime type mediates the effectiveness of IFI assistance in developing economies, after trade reforms have been adopted. More specifically, IFIs will be more effective at assisting authoritarian regimes with domestic tax reforms as a substitute for trade taxes than they will be in poor democracies. Democratically elected leaders inadvertently undermine multilateral assistance with tax reforms because they are more susceptible to middle- and upper-class demands for lower taxes in a competitive global economy. In authoritarian regimes, on the other hand, IFIs such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund tend to be more effective because dictators are likely to experience far fewer political consequences for accepting IFI assistance and implementing tax reform in the global economy than their democratic counterparts.;

AB;It pays to be a tax haven. Ireland has become rich that way. Why do not all countries cut their capital taxes to get wealthy? One reason is structural. As the standard model of tax competition explains, small countries gain from competitive tax cuts while large countries suffer. Yet not all small (large) countries have low (high) capital taxes. Why? The reason, we argue, is political. While the standard model assumes governments to be democratic, more than a third of countries worldwide are non-democratic. We explain theoretically why autocracies are less likely to adjust to competitive constraints and test our argument empirically against data on the corporate tax policy of 99 countries from 1999 to 2011.;

AB;We map trends of tax policy change in developing countries and transition economies since the 1980s, compare them to tax trends in the advanced Western democracies and review some of the explanations offered by the contributions to this volume. We find that non-Western countries follow the lead of Western countries in some important respects but not in others. While non-Western countries brought their general revenues closer to Western levels and copied important features of Western consumption taxation including higher value added tax revenues and lower revenues from trade taxation, they failed to emulate the hallmark of 20th-century Western taxation: a strong and progressive personal income tax. The taxation trends are closely associated with socio-economic changes (as summarized by GDP per capita) and structural factors (as summarized by country size). Yet the impact of political institutions on taxation is non-linear and complex.;

AB;This paper draws on the work of Antonio Gramsci and Karl Polanyi in analyzing the consequences of legal regimes that regulate genetically modified foods. Against the tide of neoliberalism, a binding, precautionary agreement over trade in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has emerged through the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. This Protocol exemplifies what Polanyi termed the 'self-protection of society,' the second phase of his double movement. The Protocol's final form was a product of European governments' responses to public concerns over the potential environmental and health impacts of GMOs in an unregulated global economy. This 'self-protective' turn has been manifest at regional and national scales, including in Australia. Drawing on Gramsci, I argue that this unlikely turn emerged in the context of shifting public opinion, effective anti-GMO activism, and alternative discursive framings. It took hold with European publics and governments, generating the relations of force needed to become the hegemonic framing of GMOs globally. The objectives of this paper are thus to demonstrate how a double movement has occurred in the regulation of GMOs and to use Gramsci's relations of force to explain how this double movement has nonetheless failed to challenge the underlying neoliberal basis of GMO agriculture as it exists today.;

AB;"Local human rights organizations (LHROs) are key domestic and transnational actors, modifying, diffusing, and promoting liberal norms; mobilizing citizens; networking with the media and activists; and pressuring governments to implement international commitments. These groups, however, are reliant on international funds. This makes sense in politically repressive environments, where potential donors fear government retaliation, but is puzzling elsewhere. We interviewed 263 LHRO leaders and key informants from 60 countries, and conducted statistically representative surveys of 6180 respondents in India, Mexico, Morocco, and Nigeria. Based on these data, we believe LHRO funding in non-repressive environments is shaped by philanthropic logics of appropriateness. In the late 1990s, transnational activists successfully mainstreamed human rights throughout the international donor assistance community, freeing up development money for LHROs. Domestic activists in the global South have not promoted similar philanthropic transformations at home, where charitable giving still focuses on traditional institutions. Instead, domestic rights activists have followed the path of least resistance toward international aid, a logic of outcomes produced by variations in global logics of (philanthropic) appropriateness.";

AB;Despite growing interest in the phenomenon of 'latecomer innovation,' the nature of this challenge - and its relationship to globalization - remain poorly understood. This article develops a theoretical framework that outlines the central policy challenges facing late innovators. It maintains that globalization has not fundamentally altered these challenges, but rather underlined the importance of surmounting them successfully. The article then employs this framework to compare China and India's progress in this regard. It finds that China has confronted the basic reform challenges more successfully, has more impressive innovation outputs, and has integrated into global networks more successfully. Yet it also notes the weaknesses of China's approach and the potential for these to constrain its development in the future.;

AB;A well-known approach to modeling international relations treats them as a two-level game played by national governments and international organizations, in which they negotiate with one another while coping with internal constraints on their action posed by domestic politics or organizational governance. Officials in these organizations can play a different two-level game, arising from their simultaneous negotiations within their personal transnational networks and their official duties in their host organizations. In each domain, they can act in ways that improves their outcomes in the other one - informal understandings facilitate subsequent formal agreement, while actions taken within their organizations implement and cement what had been negotiated informally. Multi-organizational innovation can thus be coordinated even in the absence of formal action to do so. This process is illustrated through an examination of the role of an informal transnational network in the shifting of the policies of the government of India and major aid donors in the 1960s.;

AB;Pre-crisis global governance of finance was marked by considerable preference alignment between the two regulatory great powers, the US and the EU. The article's explanation of this surprising pattern in regulatory preferences takes the institutional context of global finance seriously. It highlights the endogenous, temporal effects of inter-national institutions at the core of global economic governance: transnational regulatory networks and the soft law they produce. Transnational soft law is not simply an articulation of a focal point, we demonstrate, but also a political resource that may be employed by reform-minded agents dissatisfied with their domestic policy status quo. We label such feedback processes 'templates-as-disruptors,' meaning that the establishment of transnational soft law by regulatory networks at t(1) creates policy templates that disrupt pre-existing internal (e.g. domestic) political contests at t(2). In addition to improving an understanding of historical events and great power preference alignment, the paper highlights the temporal effects of informal cooperation and domestic--international interaction in global governance.;

AB;Under what conditions do businesses choose to reconsider their immediate, short-term competitive niches and engage in long-term, systematic thinking by searching for new business models? This crucial question is left aside by the contemporary literature on industrial policy insofar as it assumes that the primary barrier to industrial upgrading and learning is on the 'supply side' of states facilitating private firms' pursuit of their already-established drives. We inquire into the necessary conditions for businesses' engagement with long-term thinking and innovation in contexts that reinforce preferences to stay in low-innovation, high-rent niches . Drawing from five cases in 'inertial' Latin American competitive environments where industries nevertheless voluntarily broke free of inertial trajectories to seek new approaches to business, we find that conditions of 'systemic vulnerability' - a combination of shocks in demand, sectoral comp-etitiveness and civil/social conflict - force business elites to reconsider their constituents and investment timeframes. Based on these observations, we contribute to theories of industrial policy and industrial upgrading by identifying the 'demand side' factors that affect whether firms are prepared to be competent partners in today's 'assistive,' market-reinforcing models of industrial policy.;

ID;"UNITED-STATES; RENT-SEEKING; ECONOMY; FINANCE; CRISIS; CAPITALISM; DYNAMICS; MARKET; IDEAS; POWER";
AB;What is shadow banking and what is political about it? To address these questions, the paper first unpacks the mechanics of shadow banking and compares them to traditional banking. Based on this stylized explanation, it problematizes the use of the term 'banking'. Indeed, shadow banks turn long-term liabilities into short-term financial instruments, effectively turning traditional banking on its head. Next, it draws on three political science frameworks to bring to the fore and develop the political content of mainstream economic expertise on shadow banks. First, it shows that shadow banks played a significant role in the rent-seeking behavior of the financial sector by extracting regulatory rents and subsidies. Second, in spite of this, the extension of public backstops to shadow banks has largely been treated as logical institutional adaptation to a changing financial landscape. Third, shadow banking emerged alongside and contributed to growing economic inequality. It did so by acting as a credit bridge between giant pools of money seeking returns and a growing number of borrowers, raising further questions about its economic and social utility. These findings contribute to the emerging political economy literature on shadow banking, expert ideas and the relationship between finance and larger societal developments.;

ID;"GLOBALIZATION; DERIVATIVES; OFFSHORE; CRISIS";
AB;In the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, there has been an understandable focus on the financial fragility and contagion aspects of shadow banking. This article argues that shadow banking is important for another set of reasons. It has been well established that shadow banking permits the transformation of assets and financial claims. It has also been established that fiscal and regulatory arbitrage occurs through shadow banking, and associated offshore financial activities. The article develops the argument that together these are transforming the times and spaces of modern finance, and directly challenging earlier spatio-temporal concepts of finance, and the regulatory/jurisdictional order built on them. The article suggests that the longer term significance of shadow banking may not just be its role in financial crisis, or even tax and regulatory arbitrage, but that it was here that innovative forms of capital were produced and generalised which transcended the spaces and times of earlier institutional, transactional and jurisdictional concepts of capital and wealth.;

ID;"SHADOW BANKING; PUBLIC DEBT; CRISIS; FINANCE; STATE";
AB;In its capacity as debt issuer, the state has played a growing role in financial life over the last 30 years. To examine this role and connect it to shadow banking, the paper develops the concept of the 'repo trinity', which captures a set of policy objectives that central banks outlined after the 1998 Russian crisis, the first systemic crisis of collateral-based finance. The repo trinity connected financial stability with liquid government bond markets and free repo markets. It further reinforced the dominance of the US government bond market as institutional template for states adjusting to a world of independent central banks, market-based financing and global competition for liquidity. Central banks and the Financial Stability Board recognized the impossible nature of the trinity after 2008, attributing cyclical leverage (financial instability) and elusive liquidity in collateral markets to deregulated repo markets, markets systemic to shadow banking. The new approach triggered radical changes in crisis central banking but has not powered significant regulatory interventions in the absence of an alternative mode of organizing government bond markets.;

AB;Who controls global policy debates on shadow banking regulation? We show how experts secured control over how issues in shadow banking regulation are treated by examining the policy recommendations of the Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board. The evidence suggests that IO experts embedded a bland reformism opposed to both strong and 'light touch' regulation at the core of the emerging regulatory regime. Technocrats reinforced each other's expertise, excluded some potential competitors (legal scholars), coopted others (select Fed and elite academic economists), and deployed measurement, mandate, and status strategies to assert issue control. In the field of shadow banking regulation, academic economists' influence came from their credibility as arbitrageurs between several professional fields rather than their intellectual output. The findings have important implications for how we study the relationship between IO technocrats and experts from other professional fields.;

AB;The Cayman Islands is a key node in contemporary global finance, yet it is severely under-researched. This paper compiles the first 'anatomy' of the Cayman offshore financial center (OFC), utilizing all sources of publicly available data about the three main segments: banking, direct investment, and portfolio investment. The analysis is performed both diachronically to see when large inflows occurred and geographically to determine what role certain countries play in different segments. This dissection of the Cayman OFC shows that the United States is the largest counterparty in all segments with Japan playing an important role too. In fact, when excluding long-term Treasuries, Cayman is the largest holder of US securities in the world. Hedge funds are the main factor for this strong Cayman-US link. About 60% of global hedge fund assets are legally domiciled in Cayman - an extraordinary spatial concentration in such a tiny jurisdiction. A novel contribution to the analysis of the Cayman OFC is the introduction of the Anglo-America/Anglosphere approach. This approach provides one plausible explanation for the unparalleled rise of the Cayman OFC by seeing this jurisdiction as one node in an Anglo-American triangle together with the USA and the UK, Cayman's sovereign power.;

AB;Financial upheaval and unconventional monetary policies have made money a salient political issue. This provides a rare opportunity to study the under-appreciated role of monetary trust in the politics of central bank legitimacy which, for the first time in decades, appears fragile. While research on central bank communication with 'the markets' abounds, little is known about if and how central bankers speak to 'the people.' A closer look at the issue immediately reveals a paradox: while a central bank's legitimacy hinges on it being perceived as acting in line with the dominant folk theory of money, this theory accords poorly with how money actually works. How central banks cope with this ambiguity depends on the monetary situation. Using the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank as examples, this article shows that under inflationary macroeconomic conditions, central bankers willingly nourished the folk-theoretical notion of money as a quantity under the direct control of the central bank. By contrast, the Bank of England's recent refutation of the folk theory of money suggests that deflationary pressures and rapid monetary expansion have fundamentally altered the politics of monetary trust and central bank legitimacy.;

AB;Global regulatory standard setting is one of the most lucrative battlefields of the international political economy. Asymmetric influence and regulatory capture in setting such standards can undermine the regulation of economic activity, with negative externalities for the society. Scholars of International Political Economy, and of global finance in particular, are in the process of revealing the mechanisms underlying such regulatory capture and failure. I contribute to this analysis with an empirical evaluation of the mechanisms underlying influence in setting such standards. I assess the influence of nine different national, transnational, and international actors in the case of global banking regulation (the Basel II framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision). On the basis of a quantitative-qualitative assessment, I develop integration and rejection rates to measure influence in global regulation. My findings reveal that the key dynamic in setting global standards is the simultaneous influence of national (competition state) coalitions of politicians and firms as well as transnational harmonization coalitions of transnationally active firms and regulators. The results provide a basis for a new argument to understand regulatory capture and failure.;

AB;The 1999 Seattle protests, which brought thirty thousand people to the streets in opposition to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and set off a series of other protests against the multilateral economic institutions, helped spark significant academic interest in global civil society and its potential to act as a transformative force in global economic governance. In this article, however, I argue that many of the civil society actors that have sought to engage with and influence the WTO have been transformed in the process. They have both become more technocratic and increasingly moved toward advocating positions that accord with the neoliberal trade paradigm. I draw on Bourdieu's field theory to explain why and how this transformation has occurred. I argue that, in order to understand these changes among parts of civil society, we need to see multilateral trade governance as a social field, which civil society actors enter into as they seek to impact outcomes at the WTO. The case of the WTO challenges existing theories that conceive of global civil society as an exogenous force that acts upon the institutions of global governance, showing instead that global civil society is not in fact independent or autonomous but shaped and influenced by the institution it targets.;

DE;"energy; national oil companies; business-government relations; emerging economies; China; India";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; ENERGY; RISE";
AB;This paper examines the domestic sources of the internationalization of national oil companies (NOCs) in China and India. It argues that - counter to notions of state-led internationalization - the going abroad of NOCs reflects a pattern of coopetition,' i.e., the co-existence of cooperation and conflict between increasingly entrepreneurial NOCs and partially supportive and interventionist home governments. In China, the state has predominantly assumed the role of resource supplier, rarely stepping in as a veto player. In India, the NOC-government relationship has been more adversarial, with the state intervening more often as a veto player than its Chinese counterpart and only slowly emerging as a resource supplier. These patterns of internationalization can be explained by how two major trends have been playing out in the two countries: (1) the marketization of NOCs, and (2) the reform of the governance of overseas investments. The findings matter to theory and policy. First, they unpack the relational dynamics of business-government relations in hybrid models of capitalism beyond notions of top-down and bottom-up dynamics. Second, our analysis shows that the state intervenes in the international energy strategies of emerging economies as the occasional veto player rather than actively leveraging NOC internationalization for geopolitical goals.;

ID;"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; STRUCTURAL POWER; PIRACY; COPYRIGHT; BUSINESS; INDUSTRY";
AB;This article examines the transnational politics of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), the trade association of Hollywood major studios, from the viewpoint of the neopluralist. The MPA aims at stopping copyright violations by framing materially and discursively markets. For this reason, it maintains a worldwide spectrum of relations with other business associations, workers of the motion picture industries and governments. These relationships serve the MPA in a multitude of ways, from intergovernmental negotiations and litigations to anti-copyright violation efforts in association with law enforcement. Although the MPA has acquired an authoritative position beyond audiovisual sectors, its policy remains unachieved owing to pluralizing world spheres. This neopluralist perspective underlines first the fundamentally multicentered, crosscut and fragmented aspects of globalized politics which lead actors to resort increasingly to coalitions. Second, it takes a broader perspective at politics showing not only the strengths but also the weaknesses of assumed all-powerful organizations. Third, neopluralism argues strongly for a reconsideration of the dominant views on firms, economies and governments in international political economy.;

AB;The institutional arrangement chosen by the leading nations in order to address financial regulatory reform in the wake of the 2007-2009 crisis exhibits two key features of global economic governance innovation. First, it employs a minilateral approach, restricting the participants that negotiate new regulatory standards to a few, highly involved stakeholders. Second, it relies heavily on government networks that operate on the basis of soft law. The arrangement circumvents the traditional intergovernmental model that has proven overly rigid and ineffective in addressing the problems that arise from highly interconnected and fast-changing global markets. Current theories of global economic governance predict that this twofold innovation enhances the effectiveness of financial regulatory reform. Yet a study of the evolution in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives regulation shows that this is not the case. The paper then exposes three obstacles to cross-border regulatory cooperation between the two dominant players, the European Union and the United States. Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned about the distributive consequences of regulation, legislators and legislation hinder cross-border harmonization, and government networks are weak and incomplete. The paper concludes with suggestions of how to overcome coordination failure and theoretical implications for the political economy of networked governance.;

DE;"regulation; international regime; neo-liberalism; pharmaceuticals; WHO; ICH";
ID;"GENETIC-RESOURCES; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE; PROGRESS; WORLD; BUSINESS; SCIENCE; STATES; TRADE; POWER";
AB;This article investigates the relationship between regulatory globalization and neoliberal standard-setting arrangements building on industry capacities and responsibilities. Focusing on international pharmacovigilance, it recounts the history of the World Health Organization programme for the international drug monitoring, to shed light and explain the concomitant rise of the International Conference on Harmonization and of its standards. It shows that the neoliberalization of a regime or installation of a regulatory standard-setting arrangement responsibilizing the industry is inseparable from the emergence of an altogether different way of regulating pharmaceuticals (including a different definition of the problem of pharmaceuticals safety, of the organizations in charge of this problem and of the kinds of expertise and information used to make decisions about it). This happens incrementally, through gradual changes and hybridization of the existing regime, much more than all-out replacement of the regime. The rise of a market-oriented regulatory arrangement can therefore not be reduced to the influence of a neoliberal scheme, but is on the contrary linked to the ways in which a tool gains legitimacy as a way of tackling a global issue.;

ID;"PRODUCTION NETWORKS; INDUSTRY; ORGANIZATION; VOLATILITY; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT";
AB;Over the past several decades, firms have de-verticalized and internationalized increasingly complex manufacturing and service functions, a phenomenon studied across the social sciences. However, the disciplines disagree over whether the fragmentation of production is substantively novel, requiring amendments to trade theory, or is simply a secular deepening of the international division of labor. Some economists view it as just trade,' driven by well-known actor-less determinants, such as factor endowments, technology, and returns to scale, while more recent firm heterogeneity trade theories consider firm behavior. By contrast, other heterodox social science approaches differ by focusing on the strategic actions of firms and sector-specific governance as independent drivers which govern' trade and determine the division of value between countries. This paper develops novel measurements by utilizing unique transactional trade data - the raw firm-level trade transactions that comprise standard inter-country trade statistics - on 439 of China's largest exporters in 18 subsectors of the electronics and light industries, to examine whether trade is heterogeneously governed in ways theorized by the global value chain (GVC) literature. It finds substantial empirical support for GVC-governed trade, and advances both GVC and firm-centric trade theory along several fronts.;

AB;Although the role of organized business in regional economic integration is well documented, extant scholarship portrays them as mere legitimizers and partners of regional policy. This neat categorization fails to capture the complicated, multiscalarity' of business and overall civil society's role in regional governance. Drawing insights from social constructivism and empirical evidence from fieldwork conducted in 2012 and 2013 on the interactions between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and region-wide business associations and advocacy networks since the early 1990s, this article shows that although African business groups are relatively new actors at the regional stage, their impact on regional governance is substantial. This is not only in terms of getting governments to adopt particular policies or the ability to hold the state accountable, as functional institutionalists might argue, but also in terms of the regional socialization effects, namely the willingness and ability to frame issues that influence the choices of political decision-makers. Business regional governance roles also straddle competing conventional roles, and sometimes counter the neoliberal vision of regional integration, even among those that owe their emergence to regional organizations. The study also challenges the pervasive view of business actors (especially in Africa) as simply profit-seekers by highlighting the ways business actors have deployed and acted on principled beliefs about regional identity collectively or individually to forge denser and relatively effective policy coalitions that signal unfolding changes in the direction of regional policy in Africa.;

AB;"International security debates surrounding the European Union (EU) energy supply challenge commonly invoke the need for more EU hard power - e.g. getting tough on Russia or engaging directly with other exporters. This article investigates whether what might be labelled soft power with a hard edge' instead amounts to a consistent policy strategy for the EU. The central argument is that the EU has turned a weakness into strength, and developed a set of tools that sharpen the way soft power is exercised in the energy sector. The article explores how soft power affects companies that come and play' on the EU market: the rules of the Single European Market (SEM) and how they affect external firms. It also assesses the long reach of the SEM: both the gravitational pull' the SEM exerts in the near aboard', and the EU's push' to facilitate the development of midstream infrastructure and upstream investment. The conclusion is that the EU regulatory state is emerging as an international energy actor in its own right. It limits the ways states like Russia can use state firms in the geopolitical game; and it exports its model into the near abroad, thus stabilizing energy supply and transit routes.";

ID;MODEL;
AB;This article makes a theoretical contribution to the constructivist and cultural political economy literatures on crisis. While these new approaches have highlighted the imaginary dimensions of crisis, they have neglected the specifically historical forms of imagination through which events are construed and constructed as crises. In particular, they have yet to adequately theorise how the recollection of prior crises might interact with efforts to diagnose and resolve a crisis in some later present. I respond to this lacuna by developing a novel set of tools for analysing the meta-historical dimensions of crisis. These include a typology that identifies three distinct ways of recalling past crises, and a concept of history-production', which captures how different interpretive practices feed into the diagnosis and negotiation of crisis episodes. Taken together these tools help illuminate a complex interaction not only between historical analogies, narratives, and lessons, but also between these representational modes and the imaginary dimensions of crisis.;

AB;Regulatory networks are key elements of the global economy, but little is known about their variation. Why do some states prefer the creation of state-centered networks, while others advocate technocratic networks? This article addresses this question by examining the creation of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) in 1999. It advances an argument about how domestic regulatory structures and state power explain the variation in regulatory networks that empower certain actors over others in shaping global financial regulation. This article finds that while the USA favored a state-centered FSF, driven by finance ministries, European states preferred a technocratic forum, driven by international bodies. This is because the USA can secure control of state-centered networks given its bargaining weight, while European states tried to constrain US power through technocratic structures, especially under conditions of domestic regulatory fragmentation. The final outcome was a state-centered FSF dictated by the USA. By analyzing primary archival material and interviews with key policymakers, this study sheds light on the state preferences and bargaining capabilities of G7 states. This article also generates portable and testable implications for the creation of other regulatory networks.;

ID;"VALUE CHAINS; ANTIDUMPING POLICY; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; EUROPEAN-UNION; CHINA; MARKET; ORGANIZATION; REFLECTIONS; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES";
AB;This paper seeks to shed light on the interactions between public institutions and global production networks (GPNs) through a case study of the 2012-2013 European Union anti-dumping investigation on Chinese solar panels. Drawing on trade data and interviews, as well as press reports and position papers, I analyze the facts of the case and the debate around it and explore the impacts on the geography of production. The case draws attention to two issues which deserve greater attention in research in the GPN tradition. First, the position of companies within a GPN may dictate their political interests more clearly than their nationality. Second, GPNs are seen to be malleable. They can adjust their structures in reaction to new trade restrictions. This fact draws attention to the need to incorporate institutional factors, like trade policy, more effectively into GPN analysis. I propose some criteria to help researchers to do so. Finally, in terms of broader political economy, the case illustrates how, in the post financial crisis context, their domestic market is becoming an important lever for the Chinese government in international negotiations. Thus, at least in the trade sphere, the rise of China as a consumer market is changing global power relations.;

AB;"This article examines Brazil's unique experience with bilateral investment treaties (BITs) - the country signed 14 of them in the 1990s, but none was ever ratified. The case is puzzling for a number of reasons. First, BITs were an initiative of the presidency, and the Brazilian political system is notorious for executive branch's high level of success at enacting legislation. Second, the record of treaty ratification is very high in the country; between 1988 and 2006, 98% of the treaties signed entered into force in less than 18 months. Finally, the Brazilian Congress approved various investor-friendly policies that required even higher voting thresholds in the same period that BITs were being negotiated. We use primary legislative data and interviews with policymakers and bureaucrats to argue that a concentrated but strong ideological opposition in the Congress certainly contributed to hinder BIT ratification, but an unresolved executive - which addressed most investor's demands through alternative channels - was the decisive factor in explaining non-ratification. Ultimately, our findings imply that scholars need to open the black box of the executive in order to better understand the determinants of treaty ratification.";

AB;The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is responsible for monitoring, analyzing and ultimately stabilizing US financial markets. It also has unrivalled access to economic data, high-level connections to financial institutions, and a large staff of professionally trained economists. Why then was it apparently unconcerned by the financial developments that are now widely recognized to have caused the 2008 financial crisis? Using a wide range of Fed documents from the pre-crisis period, particularly the transcripts of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), this paper shows that Fed policymakers and staff were aware of relevant developments in financial markets, but paid infrequent attention to them and disregarded significant systemic threats. Drawing on literatures in economics, political science and sociology, the paper then demonstrates that the Fed's intellectual paradigm in the years before the crisis focused on 'post hoc interventionism' - the institution's ability to limit the fallout should a systemic disturbance arise. Further, the paper argues that institutional routines played a crucial role in maintaining this paradigm and in contributing to the Fed's inadequate attention to the warning signals in the pre-crisis period.;

ID;"GOVERNMENTALITY; GOVERNANCE; LESSONS; STATES";
AB;Countering cross-border crime is conventionally portrayed as a struggle between a new breed of transnational criminals and a defensive reaction by state authorities. In contrast, this paper argues that combating quintessentially transnational crimes like piracy and money laundering increasingly depends on private transnational companies fighting crime for profit by selling their services to other private firms. The paper broadens the literature on private security and global security governance by focusing on transnational responses to transnational threats in previously neglected maritime and financial realms. The rise of such corporate crime-fighters is explained by the recent evolution of environments structured by overlapping sovereignty claims which limit state enforcement while simultaneously creating new markets for security services. These cases represent instances of global governmentality insofar as they are diffuse, networked exercises of indirect power carried out by private actors, situated in markets, who are responsible for policing themselves and others.;

ID;"ECONOMY; POWER; KNOWLEDGE; MONETARY; CRISIS";
AB;Starting from an observation about the high-profile predictive failures of Value-at-Risk (VaR), an internationally instituted financial risk model, this article has attempted to make sense of its continued use by analyzing its productive, rather than predictive, power. This line of inquiry leads me to identify VaR's (counter)performative effects and the way in which it produces banks as authoritative, responsible managers of an uncertain financial future. Viewing financial markets through the lens of Keynesian uncertainty and model performativity helps explain VaR's failures by revealing VaR to be an inherently limited and potentially destabilizing practice. Its use participates in the construction of a financial system that is only temporarily stable and controllable. At the same time, VaR is an important source of authority for banks vis-a-vis regulators and the public because it represents the future as statistically calculable and expert prediction as the optimal, objective mode of preparing for that future. This, in turn, makes less thinkable other responses to uncertainty - ones that might be better suited to contend with the possibility of devastating losses unforeseeable - and perhaps produced - by the widespread use of VaR.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL-MONETARY-FUND; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; ORGANIZATIONAL FIELDS; EPISTEMIC COMMUNITIES; POLICY SPACE; CRISIS; TRADE; DEPENDENCE; AGREEMENTS; AMERICAN";
AB;Staff play a key part in designing IMF conditionality, and yet the literature provides a narrow view of their motivations. This article shows how the design of IMF conditionality is linked to the normative orientations of the staff and their common professional training. Professional ties from similar training help to bind the staff together around a shared set of normative orientations that inform the IMF's policy goals. When borrowing-country officials do not share these orientations, the staff are motivated to tighten conditionality. This behaviour also fits with staff concerns about time-inconsistency and moral hazard. I find robust statistical support for this argument using a dataset based on the professional ties that exist between the IMF staff and borrowing-country officials. Yet conditionality is not found to be more lenient when country officials share the normative orientations of the IMF staff. Staff concerns about time-inconsistent preferences and moral hazard likely weigh against more lenient treatment where normative adherence is stronger.;

AB;The paper discusses the problem of the Southern European (SE) capitalism and its difficult path into the EMU (European Monetary Union), looking at the remote causes of the crisis that hit these economies. For this reason, we consider European countries as a set of asymmetrically integrated variety of capitalism. The institutional configuration chosen by Europe to aggregate the many varieties of capitalism not only reduced the political autonomy of the single states, but effectively hindered the specific coordination mechanism of Southern European (SE) capitalism which was importantly based on state intervention as a structural element and on inflationary policies. Despite the deep market-oriented reforms this change caused both structural and macroeconomic unbalances. The aim of the paper is to integrate some principles of the variety of capitalism and the dynamics of institutional change with some insights inspired by the work of Arrighi to supply a synthetic and 'alternative' perspective on the difficult role that Southern countries are experiencing in Europe.;

AB;Do Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) affect national policy? This study critically examines assertions of a possible convergence to neo-liberal standards induced by sovereign bond ratings. By arguing that the role of the agencies in the global political economy has been exaggerated, the study finds that CRAs do not have a direct causal effect on domestic economic reforms. Employing a sample that covers the great majority of rated countries, it is shown that there is a robust trend towards deregulation and reform in accordance with neo-liberal standards. Nevertheless, sovereign bond ratings are not directly related to this process. Lower rated countries, or those more frequently downgraded, do not differ significantly from the highly rated countries in their pattern of policy reform. This result holds for policy domains such as regulation of credit, labour and business, inflation levels, legal structure and security of property rights, and the size of the public sector. It is concluded that the role of the CRAs as potential instigators of domestic reform is limited.;

AB;"One of the most important developments in the modern global economy is financial globalization. This has raised threats to the stability of political regimes in two ways: (1) by enhancing the possibility of a financial crisis that could cause political turmoil; and (2) by easing access to foreign sources of financing for opposition political groups. I argue that state capitalism - defined as state-owned publicly listed corporations - is greater among one-party regimes as a way to address these dual threats. One-party regimes have both the motivation and a greater institutional capacity for addressing these threats in comparison to other regimes. Tests are conducted on 607 firms in 1996 and 856 firms in 2008 across seven East Asian economies, and are supplemented with case studies of Malaysia and South Korea. The evidence suggests that financial globalization is contributing to the rise of the state as a counter reaction.";

It then examines the international political economy literature on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and financial (sovereign debt) markets that played such a key role in the unfolding of the sovereign debt crisis. Finally, it outlines longstanding academic debates on the main 'asymmetries'; in European economic governance, and provides a critical overview of the three main policy and institutional reforms adopted by European Union governments in response to the crisis.";

AB;This paper sets out to explain why Spain experienced a full-fledged sovereign debt crisis and had to resort to euroarea financial assistance for its banks, whereas Italy did not. It undertakes a structured comparison, dissecting the sovereign debt crisis into a banking crisis and a balance of payments crisis. It argues that the distinctive features of bank business models and of national banking systems in Italy and Spain have considerable analytical leverage in explaining the different scenarios of the crises in each country. This bank-based' analysis contributes to the flourishing literature that examines changes in banking with a view to account for the differentiated impact of the global banking crisis first and the sovereign debt crisis in the euroarea later.;

ID;"CRISIS; UNION";
AB;For many political economists, the loss of monetary sovereignty is the major reason why the Southern periphery fared so badly in the Euro area crisis. Monetary sovereignty here means the ability of the central bank to devalue the exchange rate or to buy government debt by printing the domestic currency. We explore this diagnosis by comparing three countries - Hungary, Latvia and Greece - that received considerable amounts of external assistance under different monetary regimes. The evidence does not suggest that monetary sovereignty helped Hungary and Latvia to stabilize their economies. Rather, cooperation and external assistance made foreign banks share in the costs of stabilization. By contrast, the provision of liquidity by the European Central Bank inadvertently facilitated the reduction of foreign banks' exposure to Greece which left the Greek sovereign even more exposed. By viewing the Euro area as a monetary system rather than an incomplete state, we see that what is needed for Euro area stabilization is cooperation over banking union, rather than a fully-fledged federal budget.;

This paper explores Hungary's financial nationalist turn and its surprisingly successful resistance to IMF and EU pressures to change course. We open by theorizing financial nationalism, and then trace its ideational roots and contemporary character in Hungary. We subsequently argue that two international factors ironically enabled Orban to take his financial nationalist ideas from theory to practice: 1) IMF and EU policies that first contributed to Fidesz's electoral victory and then made it difficult to counter Orban once in power; and 2) the tolerant behavior of international bond markets. In particular, Orban's willingness and ability to use unorthodox, financial nationalist policies to control government deficits and debt both reduced EU and IMF leverage over Hungary and encouraged bond markets to overlook the unsavory politics that produced those numbers.";

AB;This paper seeks to understand and explain the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) evolving relationship with the European Union (EU) before and after the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Prior to this crisis, the two sides operated on parallel tracks with little scope for mutual adjustment even during the economic turmoil of the 1970s. After the global financial crisis, the IMF emerged as a de facto institution of the EU thanks to European leaders' delegation of supervisory powers to both the Fund and the European Commission. The reasons for, and consequences of, this dual delegation are explored here by means of amultiple supervisor variation on the classic principal-agent-supervisor approach.;

ID;UNION;
AB;Since the financial crisis hit the EU in 2007/8, the governance structures of the euro area have undergone significant changes, most of them incremental. There is, however, one substantial innovation: the euro area's building of its capacity to deal with liquidity crises in member states. This article seeks to explain why the governments, which initially seemed to converge on a euro-area-only approach, decided to shape their crisis management structures around an external actor, the International Monetary Fund. It argues that the concept of learning under severe time constraints and external pressure helps to understand the sudden decisions taken on crisis management and governance reform which embed the IMF in the euro area. The analysis identifies learning in three areas crucial for the design of the crisis management set-up: in the field of practical lending and programme implementation, in the understanding of the nature of the crisis and in the evolving acknowledgement of the incompleteness of the euro area's governance set-up.;

AB;The behaviour of sovereign bond investors stands at the heart of the euro area debt crisis. By pushing upward the yields on the government debts of member states standing in the eurozone's periphery, investors caused, in a self-fulfilling way, the crisis that ultimately threatened the eurozone's integrity and the euro's survival. So how do we explain the behaviour of market investors before, during and after the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis? Why did investors not discriminate in their pricing of eurozone sovereign bonds before the crisis? Why did they abruptly change their minds in 2010? And why have they gradually felt reassured enough from mid-2011, depending on the country, to ask for significantly lower yields on sovereign bonds? To answer these questions, the paper argues that investors' confidence rests to a large extent on the expectation of the eurozone's solidarity, which is why large-scale multilateral solutions coming from the euro area were more successful in resolving the crisis than unilateral ones coming primarily from the debtor countries. As a result, this paper improves our understanding of the international political economy of financial (currency, bank and debt) crises by looking at the particular case of a monetary union with a single currency.;

ID;"REGULATORY CAPTURE; POLITICS; CRISIS; IDEAS; ELITE";
AB;Who writes the rules of global finance? This article explains how the transnational financial policy community can influence the content of financial governance by organizing itself via a club model. This agent-centered explanation advances the concept of a club to highlight the mechanisms through which actors operate, the expertise and skills valued by this community and the way in which principles for what constitutes appropriate financial governance are derived. Evidence is provided by an investigation of the Group of Thirty, part-think tank, part-advocacy group, a hybrid organization whose members are active in both the official and private sectors. Club characteristics can be seen in the group's high profile and prestigious membership, which self-presents a strong sense of honor. The article highlights the club as a location for those traditionally understood as financial elites. It emphasizes the collective attributes of the club, such as reputational consistency of membership, but also the importance of a track record of policy work for the enduring relevance of club arrangements in agenda-setting, consensus building and establishing mechanisms for private influence in financial governance. The study draws on 80+ interviews with key stakeholders from the community, including group members, conducted between 1998 and 2010.;

DE;"shadow banking; financial regulation; financial crisis; securitization";
AB;"This article examines the role of the shadow banking system in the global financial crisis of 2007-9. In order to do this, one must first explain the reasons for the explosive growth of shadow banking in the immediate pre-crisis era. Current explanations for this growth tend to hold two contrasting positions: one emphasising factors endogenous to the banking sector (notably regulatory arbitrage and financial innovation); the other emphasising exogenous factors (notably the 'search for yield'). Integrating these two explanations, in this article we develop a disaggregated view of the shadow banking system. After clarifying the nature of the relation between the regulated and shadow banking systems, we inquire more closely into the different entities that inhabit the shadow banking system, the different activities that these entities performed and the different financial products that these entities supplied. The disaggregated view of shadow banking suggests that while some parts of the system played an important role in the initial subprime phase of the crisis through their involvement with the toxic securities that were at its centre, other parts of the system were key to the subsequent money and inter-bank phases of the crisis through their close ties with the regulated banks.";

DE;"Macro-prudential policy; financial stability; central bank independence; delegation; lobbying; regulatory capture";
ID;"MONETARY-POLICY; CENTRAL BANK; DELEGATION; REFORM";
AB;The Financial Crisis that started in 2007 ushered in new responsibilities for central banks, particularly for what is termed macro-prudential policy', or MPP. The goal of this policy is to monitor and contain overall risk in the financial sector. Implementing MPP, however, carries the potential for distributional conflict with the largest financial firms and the politicization of central bank policy. In light of this risk, this essay analyses the institutional implications of MPP for a leading central bank, the US Federal Reserve. Specifically, how will MPP affect the autonomy of the Fed to set the policy it thinks right? The analysis is based on interviews with financial regulators, including Fed staffers and policymakers, and with journalists who report on financial regulation. It is also informed by a case study of the Volcker Revolution' in monetary policy. Based on these sources, I identify the factors that contributed to Fed autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy during the Volcker Revolution and assess the extent to which those same factors hold for MPP. I close with an assessment of what MPP means for the new political economy of the Fed in particular and developed world central banks more broadly.;

ID;"GOVERNANCE; WTO; NEGOTIATIONS; ORDER; MULTIPOLARITY; AGREEMENTS; CONSENSUS; HEGEMONY; SEATTLE; POLICY";
AB;New powers, such as China, India and Brazil, are challenging the traditional dominance of the US in the governance of the global economy. It is generally taken for granted that the rise of new powers is simply a reflection of their growing economic might. In this article, however, I challenge this assumption by drawing on the case of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to show that the forces driving the rise of new powers are more heterogeneous and complex than suggested by a simple economic determinism. I argue that these countries have in fact taken different paths to power: while China's rise has been more closely tied to its growing economic might, the rise of Brazil and India has been driven primarily by their mobilization and leadership of developing country coalitions, which enabled them to exercise influence above their economic weight. One important result is that Brazil and India have assumed a more aggressive and activist position in WTO negotiations than China and played a greater role in shaping the agenda of the Doha Round. Thus, although the new powers are frequently grouped together (as the 'BRICs', for example), this masks considerable variation in their sources of power and behaviour in global economic governance.;

AB;This paper explores the similarity of agricultural and industrial protectionist foreign policies through an analysis of the political determinants of agricultural producer support in OECD countries. While most qualitative studies of agricultural protectionism assume that it is exceptional or at least in some ways still different, this paper builds on an emerging quantitative literature that finds evidence of similarity with industrial protectionism. The paper enhances first-generation general statistical models of agricultural protectionism in the political science literature by considering political-institutional variables central to the industrial protectionism literature. The results of several cross-sectional time-series analyses suggest that the politics of agricultural producer support conform to general patterns of protectionism in other areas of industry.;

TI;Vulgarisation of Keynesianism in China's response to the global financial crisis;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"global financial crisis; Keynesianism; developmental state; China";
ID;DEVELOPMENTAL STATE;
AB;When Keynesianism received renewed interest in the global financial crisis, some economists regarded China's response as exemplary of effective Keynesian counter-cyclical strategy or even a non-crisis development strategy. At the same time, there have been critical voices against China's Keynesian measures. This article therefore asks: To what extent was China's response to the global financial crisis Keynesian? What factors determined the Chinese characteristics of Keynesian policy both in design and in implementation? It points out that China did follow a Keynesian formula in its crisis response, boosted infrastructure construction, GDP growth and created some employment. However, Chinese Keynesianism is a vulgarised version that is merged with its developmental state model. It simply boasted a big state and massive deficit spending, and socialised investment without really benefiting consumers or the private sector. This article also provides an analysis of how ideational and institutional politics in China vulgarised Keynesianism and exacerbated socio-economic problems. Ideational politics included the dominance of Keynesian discourse at the beginning of the crisis and an obsession with short-term results. Institutional factors included 'firework' local government politics, the state being captured by state-owned enterprises and a concentration of central distributive power without proper monitoring over implementation.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Varieties of Capitalism; international trade; economic patriotism; Britain; globalization; capitalist development; corporate governance; France; cross-border mergers";
ID;"CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; OWNERSHIP; CADBURY; FRANCE";
AB;International market integration reduces the overlap between economic and political borders, but what, exactly, does that imply? According to some rational choice accounts, it means that globalization will eventually undermine itself by triggering protectionist backlashes. Previous scholarship has highlighted flaws in the underlying assumption that elected politicians prioritize local stakeholders over anonymous shareholders. The present article adds that, regarding foreign takeovers, levels of protectionism would vary even if governments did prioritize local stakeholders, because stakeholder preferences vary across corporate governance regimes. Where, as in the UK, coordination relies more on market mechanisms than on networks, foreign acquisitions are less disruptive, and political mobilization against them is weaker. To the extent that the internationalization of corporate ownership spreads outsider governance by destroying networks, resistance therefore declines as the market expands. Quantitative correlational evidence is supplemented by case studies of bids for three British companies that provoked unusual levels of political mobilization.;

AB;How do public regulations shape the composition and behavior of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Because many NGOs advocate liberal causes, such as human rights, democracy, and gender equality, they upset the political status quo. At the same time, a large number of NGOs operating in the Global South rely on international funding. This sometimes disconnects from local publics and leads to the proliferation of sham or 'briefcase' NGOs. Seeking to rein in the politically inconvenient NGO sector, governments exploit the role of international funding and make the case for restricting the influence of NGOs that serve as foreign agents. To pursue this objective, states worldwide are enacting laws to restrict NGOs' access to foreign funding. We examine this regulatory offensive through an Ethiopian case study, where recent legislation prohibits foreign-funded NGOs from working on politically sensitive issues. We find that most briefcase NGOs and local human rights groups in Ethiopia have disappeared, while survivors have either 'rebranded' or switched their work from proscribed areas. This research note highlights how governments can and do shape the population ecology of the non-governmental sector. Because NGOs seek legitimacy via their claims of grassroots support, a reliance on external funding makes them politically vulnerable. Any study of the NGO sector must include governments as the key component of NGOs' institutional environment.;

AB;"The rebranding of capital controls during the global crisis has widened the policy space in the financial arena to a greater, more consistent degree than following the Asian crisis. How are we to account for this extraordinary ideational and policy evolution? The paper highlights five factors that contribute to the evolving rebranding of capital controls. These include: (1) the rise of increasingly autonomous developing states, largely as a consequence of their successful response to the Asian crisis; (2) the increasing assertiveness of their policymakers in part as a consequence of their relative success in responding to the current crisis; (3) a pragmatic adjustment by the IMF to an altered global economy in which the geography of its influence has been severely restricted, and in which it has become financially dependent on former clients; (4) the need for capital controls by countries at the extremes, i.e. those that faced implosion, and also and more importantly by those that have fared 'too well'; and (5) the evolution in the ideas of academic economists and IMF staff. The paper also explores tensions around the rebranding of capital controls as exemplified by efforts to 'domesticate' their use via a code of conduct.";

DT;Article;
DE;"Brazil; norms; South Korea; stigmas; Capital controls; International Monetary Fund";
ID;IDEAS;
AB;The past three decades have shown the increasing importance of the efforts of the international financial community to socialize emerging markets to accept norms of financial governance. Social sanctions often have been used to mark non-compliant states and their policies as deviant. Yet, we know little about how deviant states strategically manage such policy stigmas in international finance and how this management shapes the international normative order. Recent scholarship in international relations suggests that stigma management strategies tend to either reinforce or fracture the international normative order. This article, by contrast, contends that such strategies also have the potential to transform the international normative order so that it resembles more closely the preferences of the deviant. This argument is illustrated using evidence drawn from Brazil and South Korea's management of the policy stigma associated with controls on capital inflows.;

DT;Article;
DE;"capital controls; financial stability; emerging markets";
ID;"POLICY; MOBILITY; ECONOMICS; POLITICS; WORLD; IMF";
AB;In the wake of the global financial crisis most emerging market and developing countries experienced a surge in capital inflows that accentuated financial fragility in those countries. Unlike similar surges in the 1990s and in the five years leading to the global financial crisis in 2008, this time many emerging market and developing countries re-regulated cross-border financial flows. According to the literature such acts are seen as quite difficult, given the pervasiveness of the 'capital mobility hypothesis' which renders that the structural power of global financial markets is too much of a match for states, especially those in emerging markets. The paper traces how Brazil and South Korea were able to countervail the structural power of global capital markets and put in place regulations on cross-border finance in the wake of the crisis. The paper also outlines the contours an inductive theory regarding the conditions under which emerging market and developing nations may deviate from the 'capital mobility hypotheses' and similar literatures. This concept is referred to as 'countervailing monetary power'.;

AB;"For decades past the IMF has been a byword for economic orthodoxy, which included disapproval of policy limits on cross-border capital flows. But in 2012 it announced a new ""institutional view"" giving more scope for capital flow management and in effect restricting the rights of capital owners. The Fund's program in Iceland after the October 2008 crash helped to pave the way; it was the first time the Fund had endorsed capital controls in a developed country. The essay describes Iceland's boom and bust, and how the government and IMF tried to manage the crisis. With IMF support, the government implemented capital outflow controls, initially as an emergency response and then as a longer-term stabilization measure. The control regime evolved in a complicated ""game"", sometimes referred to in public debate as ""the battle of Iceland"", between the central bank implementing a professionally-led capital account liberalization strategy versus political parties seeking to turn the controls to their advantage. From this political economy perspective we explain why the ""temporary"" capital controls remain in place more than five years on. At the end we draw some broad lessons from the Iceland case for the financial booms and busts to come.";

ID;"PREFERENCES; POLITICS; INTERVENTION; POLICY";
AB;The purpose of this paper is to consider certain consequences of large post-crisis capital flows in advanced economies. Specifically, I offer an examination of the Swiss response to large capital inflows during the early stages of the global financial crisis. Why did the Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervene in the foreign exchange market and introduce an exchange rate floor? Why did the SNB gamble with its highly valued anti-inflationary reputation in attempting to stem the appreciation of the Swiss franc? To answer these questions, this paper suggests a broader and more complete explanation than one that focuses solely on the configuration of domestic interests. Specifically, the paper argues that a thorough explanation of the SNB's response requires accounting for the changing monetary paradigm of the central banking community. This emerging monetary paradigm influenced the SNB's policy decisions by making the SNB particularly sensitive to financial stability risks and by providing it with the policy space to experiment with (macroprudential) tools to manage these risks.;

ID;"ILLICIT GLOBALIZATION; ORGANIZED-CRIME; COLLAPSE";
AB;How has the involvement of the North Korean state influenced the geographic development of North Korean drug trafficking networks? In this paper, I use global value chain analysis to examine the characteristics of North Korean trade networks engaged in drug trafficking in two time periods during which state hostility toward drug trafficking varied markedly (from the early 1990s until 2005, when the central state encouraged production and trafficking, and since 2005, when North Korea cracked down on drugs). Access to a favourable institutional environment and state resources was associated with a spatial distribution of drug trafficking activities that was both territorially concentrated and territorially dispersed while the North Korean state sought to control as much of the value chain as possible. In the second period, the North Korean central state deprived many drug trafficking networks of state support, leading to networks with territorial distributions of production, distribution, and retail concentrated within both North Korea and adjacent countries, and more complex business relationships with various levels of the North Korean state, leading to a more distributed capture of value along the value chain.;

DE;"Seychelles; International political economy; development; island economies; international tourism; precarious work";
ID;"LABOR; SEYCHELLES";
AB;International tourism is now the predominant industry driving growth in many small island developing states (SIDS). Governments of small islands in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean and Pacific have seemingly put most of their eggs into one development basket - the all-inclusive holiday in a luxury hotel, resort or cruise ship. While this industry generates employment, foreign direct investment, and income for island governments and the private sector, it also brings with it dependencies which are borne from the transnational ownership of these all-inclusive accommodations, the risks from exogenous factors - many of which are tied to the wider security of the global system - as well as the domestic economies in the source markets in Europe and North America. We reflect upon these dependencies and risks through a case study of the Seychelles based on fieldwork research conducted in 2012. Our findings highlight that the international tourism industry in the Seychelles - even in a situation of high or growing demand - creates structurally driven precarity for tourism workers who are predominantly low paid, low-skilled, and increasingly recruited from overseas. These findings provide new evidence that contributes to the growing research into tourism in IPE. Our findings highlight the precarious condition of labour in this fast growing service sector of the world economy and in so doing also adds much needed empirical insights from the South to recent debates about an emerging precariat in contemporary capitalism.;

AB;From the World Bank's 'gender equality is smart economics' to The Economist's 'womenomics' and Nike's 'girl effect', feminism seems to have well and truly penetrated the business world. Government action on behalf of gender equality is well institutionalized but private corporations appear as a new actor in this cause. This article asks: What do businesses and their public partners do in order to advance gender equality? What motivates their engagement now and how does it fit into existing public and private relationships of power? What do they mean for feminist agendas? How legitimate are they? And how effective are they? To address these questions the article examines four exemplary initiatives involving businesses in advancing gender equality and women's empowerment: the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women Global Initiative, the World Economic Forum's Women Leaders and Gender Parity Program, the European Union's Programme on Gender Balance in Decision-Making Positions, and the UN Global Compact-UNIFEM Women's Empowerment Principles for Business. Our purpose is to conceptually locate these initiatives as new private forms of governance involving partnerships with governments. We assess these initiatives employing criteria of feminist evaluation and find decidedly ambiguous results. We argue that the new attention to gender equality in business and global economic governance is both an expression of and a key process in the transformation of states and corporations in the context of global competition and restructuring.;

AB;"In light of the dramatic expansion Islamic finance (IF) has experienced over the past few decades, the industry has received increasing attention, not only within Muslim economies, but all around the world, as illustrated by the involvement of numerous non-Muslim public and private institutions. As the Islamic financial movement is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, this paper critically examines the 'materialist'-led contributions in the social sciences (especially in economics and finance) on the rise of this alternative set of practices and ideas. In doing so, social constructivism is introduced as a fertile intellectual framework to complement the current debates on this topic. At the end of this paper, three new perspectives on IF are distilled from the latter's encounter with social constructivism. These reside in (1) providing an alternative epistemological position on the encounter between conventional and Islamic financial knowledge; (2) highlighting the presence of structures of authority in the emergence of financial alternatives such as IF; and (3) emphasizing the role of key economic agents/institutions in the global diffusion of Islamic financial ideas.";

DE;"securitization; global markets; regulatory arbitrage; national regulation";
ID;"HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE; REGULATORY CAPTURE; ECONOMY";
AB;What if global governance mechanisms undermine the capacity of national banking regulators to deal with the deviant activities of their banks? Such was the case, this paper argues with respect to the Basel Accords and the regulation of the bank-based shadow-banking system. Securitization-activities by banks, driven by regulatory arbitrage have been an integral part of the shadow banking sector and a central transmission mechanism during the financial crisis. They have been identified as problematic by the international regulatory community since 1999, motivating reforms in Basel 2. This paper investigates why, nevertheless, regulatory loopholes that allowed banks to engage in these activities without core capital charges persisted in almost all Western jurisdictions pre-crisis. It lays emphasis on the global nature of the securitization business in conjunction with its national regulation, and shows that these national regulations on the fringes of global banking regulation were driven by competitiveness concerns. The Basel Accords were central in this dynamic, as they guaranteed the global nature of this market and gave national banking regulators the leeway to exempt securitization-activities from global regulation. Rather than eliminating competitive inequity concerns, the Basel Accords channelled them to its fringes, where they introduced a regulatory race to the bottom.;

DE;"social facts; discourse; industry mobility; hedge funds; Regulatory competition; power";
ID;"FINANCIAL-MARKETS; CAPITAL MOBILITY; STATE; POLITICS; GLOBALIZATION; HARMONIZATION; TAXATION; SYSTEM; POLICY; EU";
AB;Concerns about national competitiveness can undermine the prospects of enhanced financial regulation, as the threat of industry relocation makes states less willing to tighten rules. This logic seems applicable in the case of the European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive: in fear of managers relocating, the UK, which hosts almost the entire European alternative investment sector, successfully advocated a watering down of the proposed requirements. This paper, however, questions the origins of the - seemingly natural - British negotiation position. The empirical record confirms that the relocation threat is not a necessary fact imposed by a global logic of market forces, but a scenario constructed and contested both by the regulator and firms. The scale and imminence of the threat posed to the UK's competitiveness depends on the use and function of competing narratives about hedge fund managers' relocation and these narratives inform the behaviour of both hedge fund managers and their regulator. The British authorities hence not only influence the degree of regulatory competition through acts of liberalisation, but also through their influence on dominant narratives. This means that regulatory competition is a social, not a brute fact, and that the associated power relationship between state and market actors is discursively produced.;

ID;"EUROPEAN INTEGRATION; ORGANIZATIONS; SUPPORT; TRADE; INTERDEPENDENCE; GOVERNANCE; POSITIONS; ATTITUDES; CITIZENS";
AB;Why do political parties increasingly address international institutions? This paper analyses the politicisation of international governance, that is, a process in which institutions' policies and procedures become salient and controversial on the level of mass politics. It uses data on party platforms' content from 26 OECD countries to test a number of explanations for politicisation. Results suggest that scholarly debate tends to overestimate the role of globalisation for driving politicisation, while institutional variables are too often neglected. First, increased scope of international governance has made questions of international governance much more salient topics of party manifestos. Second, recent shifts of political authority to the international level can explain increased contestation of international governance to a remarkable extent. What is more, the contestation of international authority in the realm of electoral politics seems to be substantively shaped by exclusive nationalism, but not by democratic concerns.;

DE;"United States; Financial regulation; financial consumer protection; European Union; international political economy; transnational civil society";
ID;"POLITICS; POLICY; GOVERNANCE";
AB;The literature on financial regulation has typically emphasized the role of the powerful financial industry in shaping regulatory outcomes. However, capture theories cannot explain the prominence of financial consumer protection in post-crisis reform agendas. By contrast, this article argues that, despite their collective action disadvantage, a polymorphous network of civil society organizations was able to gain momentum after the financial crisis and to influence the financial reform process. In this policy window, where decision-makers were looking out for an alternative source of expertise, a transnationally connected civil society (TCS) network successfully mobilized to place consumer protection on reform agendas in tandem with public entrepreneurs and on the back of a popular backlash against big finance. This argument will be explored through a comparative study of the impact of transnational pressures on policy-makers in Europe and the US in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. In the conclusion, the article shortly discusses the substance of the financial reforms that have been undertaken.;

It is apparent that industrial policy options in developing countries are limited by the TRIPs, GATS, TRIMs and SCMs agreements under the WTO. However, policy options are not fully closed, and a narrower range of policies is still available. Focusing particularly on TRIMs, this paper examines the contrasting development of the automotive industries in Thailand and Malaysia, showing the different ways these countries have carved out new industrial policies within the now available policy space.;

TI;Assets or liabilities? The politics of bank ownership;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;

DE;"Foreign bank ownership; banking sector protectionism; bank regulation; bank supervision; financial instability; European debt crisis";
ID;"EAST-CENTRAL-EUROPE; FINANCE; UNION; CRISIS; WORLD";
AB;By 2014, there was significant variation across the global economy in the levels of domestic and foreign bank ownership among states. While major emerging and most advanced countries continued to protect domestic control over the bulk of their banking assets, a number of developing and transition economies had opened their banking markets to unprecedentedly high levels of foreign bank ownership. This introduction to a special issue on the politics of bank ownership examines why states have taken such divergent paths, and maps out some of the major consequences of disparate foreign bank ownership levels. The special issue finds that banking sector protectionism against a backdrop of globalization has generated new conflicts and costs for states. Paradoxically, it is the large, powerful countries that are most susceptible to such costs and conflict, in contrast to their more open, if weaker, counterparts. In addition, we find that high levels of foreign bank ownership have not resulted in significant vulnerability for host states, as some scholars had predicted. In some cases, foreign bank ownership can even improve a weak state's power position. Finally, we conclude that states' varying approaches to banking sector protectionism and openness complicate efforts to supranationalize bank regulation and supervision, exacerbating financial instability.;

ID;"CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CAPITALISM; CRISIS; TRANSFORMATION; VARIETIES; INVESTORS; SYSTEMS; COUNTRY; FINANCE";
AB;We investigate the character of the market for corporate control (i.e. takeovers) in French and German banking. The key feature of this character is the marked ability of French and German banks to resist unsolicited takeover bids, especially - although not exclusively- those from foreign competitors. We present an institutional perspective to account for the restrained character of takeovers in French and German banking. Our perspective is composed of two elements. First, institutional arrangements are important since they structure power relations among firm stakeholders by providing opportunities, as well as imposing constraints, to influence the decision-making process in which takeover transactions take place. Second, institutional arrangements provide firm stakeholders with several potential opportunities, not just one, to block unsolicited bids since takeover contests are composed of sequences of decisions for which approval is needed at each stage. French and German banks have used different mixes of institutional arrangements, themselves located at different stages of takeover transactions, to secure restrained markets for corporate control. Our institutional analysis, in turn, also illustrates an important shortcoming of banking sector protectionism, namely the contribution of protection from unsolicited takeover bids to the building of banks carrying systemic risks.;

AB;"As a response to the crisis in the British banking system and reduced lending, the British government established Project Merlin, a series of lending targets aimed at boosting lending to the British economy, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular. Given the economic importance of the targets, however, this paper questions why the Merlin agreements were so ineffective. Three explanations are given: first, in light of the challenges in accessing wholesale funding for the largest UK-owned banks, there was a lack of capacity and incentive to lend more; second, the lack of decisive intervention by the British state to compel banks to lend was also a determinant; third, though, I argue that boosting actual lending figures was not the primary aim of Project Merlin. Instead, the targets were performative, rather than substantive. I argue that these three explanations have important implications for the varieties of capitalism (VoC) debate and the economic and political economic literature on foreign versus domestic bank ownership. To the first literature, the article explains the degree to which politics underpins the structure of even the UK's purportedly liberal market economy (LME), whilst to the second, it explores the limitations to political control over even domestically-owned banks.";

TI;When do foreign banks 'cut and run'? Evidence from west European bailouts and east European markets;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Foreign bank ownership; Vienna Initiative; cutting and running; bank subsidiaries; financial crisis; European integration";
ID;FINANCIAL CRISIS;
AB;Very high levels of foreign bank ownership in central and eastern Europe (CEE) gave rise to fears that the region would be vulnerable to 'cutting and running' during a financial crisis, whereby western parent banks would repatriate capital and liquidity to their home markets and abandon their CEE clients. Such fears were compounded by the economic nationalism of late 2008 and early 2009 in western Europe, as well as by west European bank bailout programmes that privileged home markets over foreign ones. Although CEE experienced a severe credit crunch in late 2008, compared to other financial and economic crises, western bank behaviour in CEE has not amounted to 'cutting and running'. While many experts credit the 'Vienna Initiative' for maintaining foreign bank exposures in the region, this paper argues instead that it was the deep form of financial integration to which CEE was subject that kept banks committed. Specifically, western banks' 'second home market' business model, in which capital moved east via foreign-owned bank subsidiaries as opposed to primarily via branches or cross-border lending, led to only moderate retrenchment from CEE.;

AB;How do international investors evaluate sovereign borrowers whose histories and institutions are too new or weak to send strong signals about their creditworthiness? In this paper, I suggest that the perceived creditworthiness of many transition countries' governments rests on a 'transfer' of good reputation from prestigious multinational banks, as foreign direct investors. The entry of reputable foreign banks into a transition country signals to international financial markets about the financial strength of that host economy. It also involves the transfer of the status of lender of last resort to the foreign parent bank. Foreign bank penetration can thus create optimistic expectations about a host country's capacity to service its sovereign debt. Using panel data for 23 transition economies during the period of 1996-2009, my empirical results provide support for the argument stressing the exogenous role of foreign financiers as enhancers of the credibility of host country governments. The results are robust to instrumental variable analysis and the inclusion of number of controls for alternative determinants of investors' perceptions of country risk. This proposition is further backed by evidence from three transition countries: Hungary, Estonia and Ukraine.;

TI;Post-socialist housing meets transnational finance: Foreign banks, mortgage lending, and the privatization of welfare in Hungary and Estonia;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Financial crisis; banks; mortgages; welfare state; Eastern Europe";
ID;"CRISIS; STATE";
AB;This paper asks how public policies have shaped the build-up of crisis-prone housing finance markets and whether they have mitigated or reinforced the associated risks for citizens in East Central Europe. Analyzing the mortgage lending booms and busts in Hungary and Estonia, the paper finds that different policy priorities did not matter too much for the build-up of the mortgage boom and the associated risks households had to face. Rather, early decisions for encompassing house privatization and the non-existence of mortgage markets have led to a pent-up demand for housing finance, while the transnationalization and EU convergence of the financial sector have provided the supply for mortgage lending from the early 2000s on. Policy-makers in both countries, albeit to different degrees, have supported the mortgage boom and have by-and-large failed to correct for the risks of their population. In the wake of the global financial crisis, however, policies started to sharply diverge. While the Estonian government has relied on market mechanisms and private market actors to cope with the crisis, the Hungarian government engaged in far-reaching interventionist policies to unmake some of its devastating consequences for indebted house-owners. The paper explains its findings by the combination of different welfare state traditions and patterns of party competition.;

ID;"INTERNAL MARKET; FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE; INTEGRATION; POLITICS; CRISIS; GOVERNANCE; INTERESTS; EUROZONE; BACK; EU";
AB;What is the optimal scope of regulatory harmonization in European financial sector governance? I argue that the levels of foreign ownership and domestic bank internationalization are important determinants of the extent to which governments are prepared to endorse European solutions in banking supervision or prefer national ones. I test two hypotheses about the impact of foreign ownership and domestic bank internationalization on regulatory preferences. This article shows that being a host jurisdiction to foreign financial institutions constrains states' ability to steer credit flows and tackle perceived threats to national financial stability. As a consequence, decision-makers seek to preserve some national regulatory autonomy. Especially during economic downturns, national supervisory authorities have strong incentives to pursue policies that minimize losses for domestic stake-holders and shift burdens onto foreign ones.;

AB;This article analyses the politics of banking and fiscal union in the EU in the context of continued threats to financial stability in Europe. Contrasting the expectations of functional responses and power politics, it finds that the behavior of the states and the outcome of negotiations most closely resembles contemporary realist expectations. Minimal supranationalism takes place to prevent complete collapse, but the main development is that financially powerful member states coerce and impose changes on weaker member states, without committing to the financial transfers that the latter require to survive the financial crisis, with negative consequences for European financial stability.;

AB;"Despite the onset of the current economic crisis there has been no significant move towards protectionism amongst most of the world's economies. Although rational institutionalist explanations point to the role played by the constraining rules of the World Trade Organisation, countries have largely remained open in areas where they have not legally bound their liberalisation. While accounts emphasising the increasing interdependence of global supply chains have some merit, I show that such explanations do not tell the full story, as integration into the global economy is not always associated with support for free trade during the crisis. In response, I develop a constructivist argument which highlights how particular ideas about the global trading system have become rooted in policy-making discourse, mediating the response of policy elites to protectionist pressures and temptations. Trade policy-makers and a group of leading economists have constructed an ideational imperative for continued openness (and for concluding the Doha Round, albeit less successfully) by drawing on a questionable reading of economic history (the Smoot-Hawley myth); by continually stressing protectionism's role as one of the causes of the Great Depression non-liberal responses to the current crisis have been all but ruled out by all except those willing to question the received wisdom.";

AB;The power of financial industry groups is a subject of widespread academic and public debate. Existing international political economy (IPE) research has highlighted how different resources, institutions and structural features allow financial industry groups to influence financial regulatory policymaking. In so doing, however, this literature routinely tends to neglect the wider array of interest groups beyond the particular financial industry groups being regulated. Actor plurality is usually assumed to be low or inconsequential. Such an assumption obscures the important role that actor plurality may play in the policymaking process. We present new quantitative and qualitative evidence demonstrating how global financial regulatory politics is more plural than most existing depictions would suggest. Actor plurality can have significant effects in 'leveraging' the influence of financial industry groups, which are often able to tie in their interests with those of other private sector groups affected indirectly by the regulation in question. We illustrate this underappreciated facet of financial industry power through a variety of case-based evidence from the formation of banking and derivatives rules in various jurisdictions, both before and after the global financial crisis of 2008-10.;

ID;"UN SECURITY COUNCIL; WORLD-BANK; INTERNATIONAL-POLITICS; AID";
AB;This paper explores the political factors that determine the price of loans offered to borrowing countries by multilateral development banks (MDBs). The reasons why MDBs set their prices at a given level and why those prices might vary from one MDB to another has received scant attention in academia, even though inexpensive loan costs are the primary reason countries borrow from MDBs. The paper explores these issues in three MDBs, each with a different composition of shareholding countries - the World Bank (controlled by wealthy non-borrowing countries), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) (more evenly balanced between non-borrowing and borrowing countries) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) (controlled by borrowing countries). Evidence indicates that MDB shareholder composition has a major impact on loan prices, in sometimes unexpected ways. While the backing of wealthy countries allows the World Bank and IADB to raise resources on capital markets more cheaply than the CAF, the interests of those same non-borrowing countries in using MDB net income make loan costs significantly higher at those MDBs - especially the World Bank - than they would be otherwise. These results provide support to an institutionalist approach in focusing on the importance of shareholding and voting rules to better understand MDB activities.;

AB;Scholars of the 'resource curse' increasingly agree that strong institutions can help countries avoid the pitfalls associated with abundant natural resource wealth. This paper argues that certain political coalitions can serve a similar function in the context of weak institutions. To explicate this argument, this paper examines how international commodity booms regularly create credit demand that surpasses available supply, often impelling exporters to seek government assistance with obtaining credit. Four case studies illustrate how coalitional politics dictated governmental responses to such demands. Where exporters were members of the ruling coalition (Chile and Argentina), their needs sparked credit sector reform and government help to access credit. Where exporters were excluded from political power (Colombia and Nigeria), government policy hindered their economic goals. These findings suggest that the resource curse may pivot on coalitional politics in important respects. The paper concludes by assessing this possibility with respect to strategies that are commonly proposed to help developing countries manage their natural resource wealth.;

AB;The pace of financial globalization across the developing world grew rapidly after developing country governments started reducing restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic equities. Studies suggest that the emergence of democracy in developing states played a critical role in facilitating the reduction of controls on foreign investment in domestic equities. Yet, the data reveals that although some developing country democracies have curtailed equity market restrictions, a significant share of developing democracies have increased barriers on foreign ownership of domestic equities. This raises an important question: when do democratic governments in the developing world raise restrictions on foreign ownership of the equities of domestic firms? We suggest that policymakers in candidate-centred developing democracies will increase equity market restrictions in response to pressure from market concentrated public sector banks. Specifically, we claim that highly market concentrated public banks have incentives and the capacity to lobby policymakers to keep the domestic equity market closed to foreign investors. We then argue that policymakers from candidate-centred-but not party-centred-developing democracies have political incentives to be responsive to such pressure, which will induce them to raise barriers on foreign ownership of domestic equities. Statistical results obtained from a comprehensive sample of developing country democracies support our hypothesis.;

DE;"Latin America; liberalization; ideology; Political economy; trade agreements";
ID;"DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; ARRANGEMENTS; INTEGRATION; IMPACT; GLOBALIZATION; BILATERALISM; INEQUALITY; REFORM";
AB;Several prominent political economy models of trade policy, at first glance, seem to suggest that leftist governments in Latin America have strong incentives to sign preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The Heckscher-Ohlin model, for instance, predicts that the ideological left in the developing world will favour trade liberalization. Other research, specifically on trade agreements, suggests that leftist governments sign such treaties to credibly signal a commitment to sound economic policies. In light of these predictions, it is perhaps surprising that many left-wing Latin American governments have been especially averse to signing PTAs. In this article, I provide an explanation for the partisan left's disposition toward trade agreements. First, I identify the ways in which PTAs can be difficult to reconcile with hardline or populist left-wing governance. Second, I explore the conditions under which left governments are most inclined to sign trade agreements. I anticipate that regional commonalities and shared partisanship increase the prospects for cooperation. A statistical analysis of PTA signing in 18 Latin American countries, as well as a more in-depth treatment of several cases, yields results consistent with my expectations. These findings have implications for the literature on the political economy of trade agreements as well as the scholarship on globalization in the Latin American context.;

AB;"This paper contributes to the literature on the mechanics of change in global economic governance. By synthesising an empirically driven case study with conceptual insights from the existing literature, I highlight three intervening variables that enabled the Legislative Mandates passed by the US Congress in 2009 on the use of social-spending targets (education and health expenditure ring fences) in IMF concessional lending to be rapidly translated into operational change. The intervening variables that stood between US domestic action and rapid operational change are: first, the existence of effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from the US Executive Director with the Mandate; second, preference congruence between other primary principals and the content of the Mandate, and; third, the existence of effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from IMF staff with the principals' collectively-sanctioned goal. The outcome observed - the near universal incorporation of social-spending targets into concessional lending arrangements - adds credence to calls for further empirical work to assess the extent of a post-Washington Consensus transition at the IMF.";

AB;The global intellectual property (IP) regime is in the midst of a paradigm shift in favour of greater access to protected work. Current explanations of this paradigm shift emphasize the agency of transnational advocacy networks, but ignore the role of academics. Scholars interested in global IP politics have failed to engage in reflexive thinking. Building on the results from a survey of 1679 IP experts, this article argues that a community of academics successfully broke the policy monopoly of practitioners over IP expertise. They instilled some scepticism concerning the social and economic impacts of IP among their students as well as in the broader community of IP experts. They also provided expert knowledge that was widely amplified by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and some intergovernmental organizations, acting as echo chambers to reach national decision makers. By making these claims, this article illustrates how epistemic communities actively collaborate with other transnational networks, rather than competing with them, and how they can promote a paradigm change by generating, rather than reducing, uncertainty.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL-MONETARY-FUND; CRISIS; CONDITIONALITY; ORGANIZATIONS; POLITICS; PREFERENCES; AMBIGUITY; EVOLUTION; WORLD; POWER";
AB;The global financial crisis has transformed the relationship between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). Until the crisis, the IMF had not lent to EU member states in decades, but now the two organisations closely coordinate their lending policies. In the Latvian and Romanian programmes, the IMF and the EU advocated different loan terms. Surprisingly, the EU embraced 'Washington Consensus'-style measures more willingly than did the IMF, which much of the contemporary literature still portrays as an across-the-board promoter of orthodox macroeconomic policies. We qualify this stereotypical characterisation by arguing from a constructivist perspective that the degree of an organisation's autonomy from its members depends on the interpretation of its mandate. IMF staff viewed the Fund's technical mandate as an opportunity to react rather flexibly to the challenges of the latest crisis. By contrast, European Commission, as well as European Central Bank (ECB), staff interpreted the vast body of supranational rules as necessitating stricter adherence to economic orthodoxy. Thus, IMF lending policies were more flexible and, at least on fiscal issues, also less contractionary.;

ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; SMALL-STATES; GLOBAL ECONOMY; LAW; TRANSFORMATION; INTEGRATION; GERMANY; SYSTEMS; FRANCE";
AB;In this article I explore empirically the determinants of the persistent cross-national variation in finance capitalism in advanced democracies. I find that the degree of strategic coordination through extra-market institutions - which protect the economic system from class and sectoral pressures and promote collaboration among state agencies, financiers, managers, and labor organizations - contributes to a country's domestic banking and financial intermediary-based development but is less conducive to the development of its securities markets. The financial liberalization reforms of the 1990s meant the emergence of an asymmetric corporatist system, whereby banks and other financial institutions played a crucial role in defining the new rules of financial governance. Conducting a panel data analysis encompassing 18 advanced democracies over the period of 1960-2005, I find evidence of the impact of strategic coordination on financial development, while controlling for alternative explanations and ensuring that my estimates capture the influence of the exogenous component of coordination. The paper shows that convergence to the Anglo-Saxon model of finance has not occurred.;

AB;In the context of a global ecological crisis, it is an important move when trade unions turn to environmentalism. Yet, the form that this environmentalism takes is often overlooked. This is especially the case with international trade unions. Based on an empirical study of international trade unions' engagement with the climate change issue, this article argues that international trade unions follow three different (and partially conflicting) strategies. I label these strategies as 'deliberative', 'collaborative growth' and 'socialist', and I examine each in turn. I argue that such analysis is important if we want to identify the potential for transforming the social relations of production that are at the root of the current climate crisis, and for identifying an alternative socio-ecological strategy.;

DE;"trade unions; International Labour Organization (ILO); core labour standards (CLS); labour markets; World Bank; global governance";
ID;"WORKERS; ORDER";
AB;Over the past decade, the World Bank has moved closer to accepting the International Labour Organization's (ILO's) core labour standards (CLS) and, in the process, sought to balance its promotion of labour market flexibility with a new focus on labour market regulation. The Bank's change of approach includes the 2009 decision to review and subsequently remove its labour market flexibility indicator (used to score the extent of labour market flexibility amongst its member-states) from its flagship publication, Doing Business. The aim of this article is to chart the softening of the Bank's emphasis on labour market flexibility and distil the contributing factors. With reference to the global financial crisis and the Bank's organizational characteristics, the article evaluates the work of international trade unions and the ILO as agenda-setters and compliance monitors and pro-labour industrialized states as 'insider advocates' in broadening the Bank's commitment to the CLS. The article demonstrates the influential nature of tacit coalitions between state and non-state actors representing a coalescence of normative values and economic interests. The Bank's changing approach to labour markets also contributes new evidence to the emerging, yet tentative, consensus that the neoliberal paradigm is undergoing a rebalancing, rather than an overhaul, in the post-crisis era.;

AB;A causal relationship between diaspora populations and bilateral foreign direct investment has been established empirically, but the question of which elements of diaspora difference are responsible for this relationship, and what this implies for development, remains unanswered. A growing literature in economic sociology and business suggests that diaspora investors are motivated by patriotism and other social and emotional factors, endowing them with unique potential as a force for international development. This literature argues that diaspora-owned firms are more socially responsible than other foreign firms, and engage in a range of economic development-promoting behaviors when investing in the homeland: hiring more local labor, paying higher wages, and making more contributions to charity. I argue that diaspora-owned firms enjoy competitive advantages in the homeland based on access and attention to information. I evaluate these theories at the firm level, using data from an original survey of 174 foreign-owned firms in the post-conflict country of Georgia. Across a range of self-reported behaviors and priorities, I find no evidence that diaspora-owned firms are more likely to engage in a specific set of socially responsible, pro-development behaviors than are other foreign firms, and some evidence that they are less likely to do so. I argue that diaspora investors are uniquely capable, but not uniquely philanthropic, when doing business in their homelands.;

AB;"Focusing on Mexico, this article makes two departures from existing studies of the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI): (1) it disaggregates investment into three types (resource-, market- and efficiency-seeking); and (2) it models variation in investment subnationally, across the 32 Mexican states. Using panel data for foreign investment between 2000 and 2009, we find that the predictors of subnational variation in investment go beyond simple geographic and economic conditions and include factors such as local political party control, social stability and the perceived effectiveness of state authorities. Moreover, the three types of investment are shaped by distinct social, political and economic dynamics. Insofar as the location and type of foreign investment can affect economic development and inequality within - and not just between - countries, the subnational distribution of investment is of consequence for both academics and policy makers.";

AB;Few issues are more important to states' security than their ability to acquire modern weaponry. Today, advanced industrial democracies possess three options for doing this. In principle, they can: autonomously produce their own armaments, import them from foreign suppliers, or collaborate with other states to co-produce common weapons. In this study, we examine the factors driving state decisions to either collaboratively or autonomously procure advanced weaponry. To this end, we analyse French and British decisions about whether or not to collaborate in the domain of combat aircraft. To preview our conclusion, we draw on the Varieties of Capitalism approach to argue that the underlying institutional structures of national political economies explain why otherwise similar states have enacted divergent policies. Within etatist France, dense exchanges and close relationships within elite networks enable large defence contractors to veto government decisions that contravene their preferences. By way of contrast, Britain's liberal market economy empowers its government to impose its preference for collaborative projects onto aircraft manufacturers, even when the latter attempt to lobby in favour of promising national designs. Thus, what variety of capitalism a state practises determines whether governments or contractors occupy the metaphorical cockpit when it comes to making procurement policies.;

AB;"Contemporary globalization has been marked by significant shifts in the organization and governance of global industries. In the 1970s and 1980s, one such shift was characterized by the emergence of buyer-driven and producer-driven commodity chains. In the early 2000s, a more differentiated typology of governance structures was introduced, which focused on new types of coordination in global value chains (GVCs). Today the organization of the global economy is entering another phase, with transformations that are reshaping the governance structures of both GVCs and global capitalism at various levels: (1) the end of the Washington Consensus and the rise of contending centers of economic and political power; (2) a combination of geographic consolidation and value chain concentration in the global supply base, which, in some cases, is shifting bargaining power from lead firms in GVCs to large suppliers in developing economies; (3) new patterns of strategic coordination among value chain actors; (4) a shift in the end markets of many GVCs accelerated by the economic crisis of 2008-09, which is redefining regional geographies of investment and trade; and (5) a diffusion of the GVC approach to major international donor agencies, which is prompting a reformulation of established development paradigms.";

ID;"GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; COMMODITY CHAIN; GLOBALIZATION; STANDARDS; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; 1990S";
AB;This paper provides a critical analysis of the emergence of an approach within the practice of international development that adopts a 'value chain' discourse, and traces the conceptual underpinnings of this discourse and practice through its translation from scholarly literature. This practical application of value chain theory has involved the selective application and interpretation, by development practitioners, of key scholarly ideas on global commodity chains, development strategies and industrialization. The specific application of value chains in Indonesian development practice, however, is silent on other aspects of the global value chain framework, such as the role of the state in mediating development strategies, power asymmetries within chains, and world-historical circumstances that shape upgrading possibilities. Despite foundational roots in critical analyses of global capitalism, recent 'value chains for development' applications appear to be perpetuating a neoliberal development agenda, which is facilitating the enhanced penetration of multinational capital into the economy and lives of the rural and urban poor.;

ID;"MODULAR PRODUCTION NETWORKS; REGIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; VALUE CHAINS; INNOVATION; KOREA; PERSPECTIVE; INDUSTRY; ECONOMY; TAIWAN; MODEL";
AB;This paper focuses on the changing governance of economic development in a globalizing era in relation to the dynamics of global value chains and global production networks. Based on recent development in such East Asian economies as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, I examine how, since the 1990s, the embedded relation between one variant of state institutions, known as the developmental state, and national firms, well integrated into global chains and networks spanning different territories and regions, has evolved. Because of the deepening strategic coupling of these national firms with lead firms in global industries, the developmental state's attempt to govern the market and to steer industrial transformation through direct policy interventions has become increasingly difficult and problematic. Through this process of strategic coupling, national firms have been gradually disembedded from state apparatuses and re-embedded in different global production networks that are governed by competitive inter-firm dynamics. While the state in these East Asian economies has actively repositioned its role in this changing governance, it can no longer be conceived as the dominant actor in steering domestic firms and industrial transformation. The developmental trajectory of these national economies becomes equally, if not more, dependent on the successful articulation of their domestic firms in global production networks spearheaded by lead firms. In short, inter-firm dynamics in global production networks tend to trump state-led initiatives as one of the most critical conditions for economic development. This paper theorizes further this significant role of global value chains and global production networks in the changing international political economy of development.;

AB;Deriving insights from the global production network (GPN) framework, we examine the recent development of the liquid crystal display (LCD) industry in South Korea. Using the GPN framework, we focus on the role of the national state as an active inter-scalar mediator in the dynamic strategic coupling process between global leading firms and local actors in globalizing regional development. We argue that the role of the national state as an inter-scalar mediator was crucial in coordinating localized growth factors with globalizing external factors to create and develop the LCD industry. This was achievable because of the legacy of the developmental state and the top-down implementation of policy in South Korea. Using the idea of the inter-scalar mediator, we specify the role of the state as a container of laws and practices and as a constructor of regional innovation systems to globalize regional development in the context of a centripetal society. A multi-strategy approach, which included one month of participatory observation, in-depth interviews and secondary data collection, was adopted in order to enhance the validity and reliability of the data.;

AB;The current global financial crisis has prompted researchers to revisit the export-oriented development models, known as the 'Washington Consensus' paradigm, that have prevailed in East Asia during the past few decades. Host domestic markets have been generally neglected in the conceptual construct and empirical analysis of export-oriented development. Drawing upon the global production networks (GPNs) perspective, the study advances an evolutionary framework to shed light on the rising domestic market in China as emerging dynamics of regional transformation in contemporary economic globalization. The study is conducted based on updated investigations of the market rebalancing of transnational corporations (TNCs) in China, and particularly the Pearl River Delta (PRD), in response to the post-crisis global-local interaction. It argues that the institutional and network embeddedness of TNCs in the processing trade regime have hampered their 'recoupling' with the domestic market and 'decoupling' from external markets. Instead, a domestic market oriented production network is emerging, driven by strategic contract manufacturers through relocation to inland China. As a pilot attempt to articulate the domestic market in the GPN framework, this study urges more research to reflect the implications of the restructuring of GPNs and market reorientation of TNCs for reshaping regional trajectories in the post-Washington Consensus global economy.;

AB;Interdisciplinary literature on global commodity chains (GCCs)/global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs) contends that inter-firm power differentials within globally networked forms of economic organization have implications for the developmental trajectories of nation-states. In this article, I advance these literatures in three ways. First, I bridge the two approaches by elaborating an exchange-theoretic conceptualization of inter-firm power that is latent in the two literatures. This conceptualization focuses narrowly on the determinants of inter-firm power asymmetries and is useful for explaining why actual production networks vary in terms of the relative power of buyers and producers. Second, I develop an empirical framework to advance basic research on the link between globally networked forms of economic organization and national economic development. In particular, I derive cross-nationally and temporally comparable country-level measurements of the average bargaining power of a country's resident firms using industry-specific international exchange (trade) networks. I demonstrate the validity of these indices through a historical analysis of trade networks in the transport equipment and garment industries and by analysing cross-national variations in wages in the two industries. Finally, I conclude by charting a parallel path for GCC/GVC and GPN research that implicates global models of network organization in macro-comparative analyses of economic development.;

AB;"In this article, we review the evolution and current status of global value chain (GVC) governance theory and take some initial steps toward a broader theory of governance through an exercise in 'modular theory-building'. We focus on two GVC governance theories to which we previously contributed: a theory of linking and a theory of conventions. The modular framework we propose is built on three scalar dimensions: (1) a micro level - determinants and dynamics of exchange at individual value chain nodes; (2) a meso level- how and to what extent these linkage characteristics 'travel' upstream and downstream in the value chain; and (3) a macro level - looking at 'overall' GVC governance. Given space limitations, we focus only on the issue of 'polarity' in governance at the macro level, distinguishing between unipolar, bipolar and multipolar governance forms. While we leave a more ambitious analysis of how overall GVC governance is mutually constituted by micro/meso factors and broader institutional, regulatory and societal processes to future work, we provide an initial framework to which this work could be linked. Our ultimate purpose is to spur future efforts that seek to use and refine additional theories, to connect theories together better or in different modular configurations, and to incorporate elements at the macro level that reflect the changing constellation of key actors in GVC governance- the increasing influence of, for example, NGOs, taste and standard makers, and social movements in GVC governance.";

ID;"PRODUCTION NETWORKS; ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY; TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; SUPPLY CHAIN; GLOBALIZATION; TECHNOLOGIES; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; SERVICES";
AB;This article seeks to argue that logistics services, and the independent logistics industry in particular, should be afforded much more attention within political economy approaches to the global economy. Widespread outsourcing processes and the increased sophistication of logistics provisions mean that the industry has arguably evolved beyond being a mere service input to occupying an integral and strategic role within many global industries. It is, therefore, intimately connected to debates about shifting governance regimes and upgrading dynamics within those industries. Conceptualising logistics from a global production network (GPN) perspective offers the potential for revealing both (1) the contribution of logistics providers to value and upgrading dynamics in client sectors and (2) the ways in which the logistics industry itself can be thought of as a multi-actor value-generation network with its own strategic and upgrading dynamics. The article distils the key contributions and limitations of prevailing business studies approaches to logistics, before charting a four-pronged research agenda that foregrounds the political economy of logistics provisions within the global economy. The analysis concludes by thinking about the implications of on-going post-crisis restructuring within the world economy for the proposed research agenda on logistics and GPNs.;

When it comes to policy implications, however, the reports revert to an agenda that departs little from the Washington Consensus. Trade and investment liberalization are discussed in detail; 'complementary policies' required to promote upgrading receive scant mention. In particular, the reports neglect the role that institutions can play in overcoming coordination problems and how enhanced state capacity is required for enforcement of competition policies and for effective participation in trade negotiations.";

AB;For at least a decade, many have argued that the predominance of the dollar as the world's currency will gradually erode, and give way to a more multipolar international monetary order. The four papers in this special issue challenge this conventional wisdom, and hold that the hegemony of the dollar remains irresistible and unchallenged. Looking carefully at available evidence, each paper argues forcefully that the dollar remains predominant, and that expectations of its decline are greatly exaggerated. Nevertheless, although the dollar stands unrivaled at the moment, the pillars of support that have historically sustained its hegemony are eroding. Three warning signs loom especially large: regarding the trajectory of American power and international influence, the role of international politics in shaping the international monetary order, and the outcomes generated by the U. S. political system. Each of these should give pause about the sustainability of unrivaled dollar hegemony indefinitely into the future.;

ID;"DOLLAR; TRADE";
AB;There has been a lot of debate lately about the shape of the international currency system. Increasingly, we are told, the world is moving toward a multicurrency system with several poles, implying that the system is becoming more competitive. Polarity, however, is a notoriously crude measure of the level of competition in any kind of system, economic or political. If analysis is to be at all accurate, it should take into account not only the number of poles in a system but also the inequalities among them - an alternative approach encompassed by the concept of concentration. In this paper we make use of the concept of concentration to provide a more accurate picture of the competitive structure of the currency system today. When taking account of concentration as well as polarity, our results suggest that the competitive structure of the system is little changed over a period stretching back more than two decades.;

AB;The dollar has been the world's first currency since the end of World War II, possibly since the inter-war period, and is the leading currency today. A growing chorus of observers believes this dollar-centered order is coming to an end. While much commentary revolves around changes in the distribution of power, measures are only loosely related to the material basis for currency dominance. A proper understanding of the dollar's global role requires a quantitative assessment of the United States' monetary capabilities and currency influence relative to potential rivals. Moreover, while there is general recognition that a shift in power capabilities away from the United States is an insufficient, although necessary, condition for the prevailing currency hierarchy to reverse, there exists no systematic exploration of how power is exercised when converting monetary capabilities into currency influence. This paper offers a systematic assessment of the monetary capabilities and currency influence of all countries in the world as well as an analysis of how the three faces of power sustain dollar hegemony.;

DE;"Unipolarity; grand strategy; dollar hegemony; hegemony; strategy; financial crisis";
ID;"POWER; ASIA";
AB;Towards the end of 2012, the US budget deficit stayed above US$1 trillion for the fourth year in a row. In the absence of the dollar's international reserve currency status, foreigners' willingness to purchase US debt would diminish sharply. 'Declinists' have argued that this Achilles' heel of US power has become increasingly fragile, with the 2008 financial crisis further eroding US monetary privileges and bearing profound implications for international security and the distribution of power in the international system. However, contrary to these accounts, this paper shows that dollar hegemony not only remains strong, but that US monetary power has in fact increased. How do we explain this? In important areas, the US' economic decline is nowhere near as pronounced as is commonly assumed. Also, its strategic power in economically important regions, particularly in East Asia, helps incentivize both allied and potential contender states into its broader monetary regimes. To the extent that a weakening of dollar hegemony forms a primary component of the declinist case, it is thus overstated. This 'deal' will not last forever, but rising powers continue to face strong incentives to remain within a US-centric order, even after the financial crisis of 2008.;

ID;"US; DOLLAR";
AB;How do international currencies get established and consolidated? What domestic and international political foundations support an international currency? And what kinds of macro-economic flows enable an international currency? In this essay we consider these perennial questions of modern IPE scholarship in reverse order to ask whether the euro could ever have become, or seek to become, a true international currency rivalling the US dollar, used not only for passive foreign exchange reserves but also as a major commercial currency outside the EU. We argue that the EU lacks the will, the ideas and the capacity to promote the euro into the status of an international currency. In this article, we concentrate on this final issue of capacity, as the will and ideas issues have already been well explored. Capacity is an issue coeval with, if not prior to, the first two issues. The EU's current institutional arrangements and its economic geography create macro-economic consequences that diminish the euro's capacity to operate as a top currency. These conflicts go beyond the well-recognized issue that the euro-zone is not an optimum currency area. Examining the euro's debilities sheds light not only on the euro's (in) capacity to rival the dollar as an international currency, but also on the future of both the euro and the dollar in the aftermath of the euro-zone crisis.;

ID;LIBERALISM;
AB;Reflections on hegemonic power have shaped the contemporary field of international political economy (IPE) within China. Shifts in the thinking of Chinese scholars correlate with China's own changing role and location in a system still most profoundly influenced by the United States. But real and perceived changes in America's position have also influenced the way in which Chinese IPE scholars are now reconceptualizing the nature of global authority and the international position of China. In one generation, the mainstream of China's IPE scholarship has moved away from its rigid Marxist origins and converged in substantial part with Anglo-American ideological traditions, now prominently including liberal institutionalism. Nevertheless, scholarship informed by other traditions, including a re-imagined Confucianism, flourishes. Major policy-changing events clearly affect the work of Chinese IPE scholars, a phenomenon hardly unknown elsewhere.;

AB;"One of the fundamental questions in the study of international political economy (IPE) is the foundation of order, stability and justice in international politics and economy. The study of international institutions and global governance is part of this larger inquiry. With China's rising importance in the global economic system, it might be expected that IPE scholarship in China would give rise to uniquely Chinese' approaches to this area of inquiry, approaches informed by China's position in the world and China's rich cultural and intellectual traditions. However, our examination of Chinese scholarship shows that thus far, it has produced little new knowledge and theoretical innovation. Why has this been the case? We argue that it is because (1) as a new field of study, IPE in China - including the study of international institutions and global governance - is still under the strong socialization effect of Western scholarship; and (2) the institutional environment in China constrains the kind of research that promises new insights and innovative perspectives. We also discuss how scholarship in China could contribute to the positive evolution of IPE globally in the future, and the obstacles that may hinder this development.";

AB;"China's rapid integration into the global economy has had undeniable implications for the Chinese state - it raises questions about how the state has simultaneously encouraged globalization and, at the same time, tried to control for globalization's impact on China's economy, its culture, and on state policy and the state itself. These implications have not been lost on PRC-based scholars of international and comparative political economy, who have focused considerable - if, as we shall argue, incomplete - attention on globalization's challenge to state sovereignty, to economic sovereignty, and on the economic role of the state. The article highlights features of the Chinese scholarship that are quite distinctive. This literature reflexively favours a strong role for the state in the context of globalization. We also observe that the literature in general is not oriented to theory-building. Instead, scholarship is largely policy-driven; there is a strong impulse to provide positive policy advice to Chinese policy-makers. Most striking, the understanding of the state in the Chinese literature remains partial; there is a marked reluctance to delve into either empirical or theoretical study of the Chinese state itself - the state itself as a subject of critical analysis is rarely considered.";

ID;COOPERATION;
AB;Unlike the depth of international political economy (IPE) research on finance and money in North America and Britain/Europe, or the amount of work that has been done inside China on the IPE of international trade, the IPE of global finance and money is still at a nascent stage inside China. The paper examines the evolution of Chinese IPE research on global finance and money and suggests that research in these issue areas appears to be reaching a turning point. The main empirical finding is that this shift in knowledge production has been induced principally by China's emergence as a financial force and the national developmental concerns this entails, as well as by the onset of the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the rise of the emerging economies' grouping. The growing Chinese scholarship on the IPE of finance and money is adding analytical depth and broadening Chinese IPE, particularly on the impact of financial globalization on developing and emerging economies. While such research will likely contribute to Chinese policymaking in the future, the scholarly test for Chinese IPE is whether and how it will contribute to filling the global knowledge gaps on the determinants of financial and monetary policy, and whether it will give rise to new understandings on global finance and money, especially the causes of international financial crises. Heretofore, much of the literature has been heavily policy-oriented and normative.;

DE;"China; constructivism; IPE; Marxism; American IPE; Chinese IPE";
AB;This paper surveys constructivist scholarship in the study of international political economy (IPE) in China. Chinese scholars in the field of IPE have until recently rarely used constructivism as an approach to study IPE for two reasons. The first, like Western IPE, is the short history of constructivism as a theoretical perspective. The second, unlike Western IPE, stems from the long-standing dominance of Marxism, China's official state ideology, in the academic field. In China, Marxism's materialist core shapes the basic research questions of IPE. Unsurprisingly then, constructivist analysis is quite alien to the dominant intellectual discourse in China. Nonetheless, of late, more Chinese scholars have begun to apply constructivist analysis. This paper surveys these developments and is divided into three sections. The first section provides an overview of how Chinese Marxist scholars approach the major issues of IPE as they relate to China. The second section provides an overview of the work of liberal-minded Chinese scholars who work on major IPE issues, another counterpoint to the Marxist school. The third section, which is the major focus of this paper, examines how Chinese scholars have applied the constructivist concepts to study major IPE issues in the Chinese context.;

AB;In this article and in Part 2 I advance a critical historiography' of IPE which excavates to the deepest foundations of the discipline. For while I very much welcome Benjamin Cohen's seminal historiographical intervention, nevertheless it obscures two foundational properties of IPE. First, identifying 1970 as the birth-year of IPE produces a distorted image of the discipline's purpose and historiography that can begin to be remedied by rehabilitating the originary era of classical political economy. Second, focussing on issues revolving around methodology and epistemology obscures the deeper Eurocentric metanarratival foundations upon which the vast majority of IPE scholarship between 1760-2012 stands. Specifically, I reveal the various Eurocentric metanarratives that underpin the orthodox traditions of classical political economy (Smith and List) and modern IPE (Gilpin and Keohane). My conclusion is that rather than producing positivist/objective (or even critical) explanations of the world economy, most of IPE has, often unwittingly, defended, promoted or celebrated Western civilization as the highest or ideal referent in the world. I follow this up in Part 2 by deconstructing open economy politics to bring my historiography upto the present while advancing an alternative non-Eurocentric empirical and theoretical research agenda for what I call inter-civilizational political economy.;

AB;In Part 1 (this issue), I deconstructed IPE, past and present, to reveal the Eurocentric foundations of the discipline. This second part completes my critical historiography by revealing how Open Economy Politics, which dominates the latest phase of American IPE, is Eurocentric. However, some readers will, quite rightly, want to know why Eurocentrism poses a problem for IPE and what an alternative non-Eurocentric approach might look like. Accordingly, this article lays out some of the basic properties of what I call inter-civilizational political economy'. To this end, deconstructing OEP is undertaken in tandem with reconstructing a non-Eurocentric inter-civilizational account of trade regime change in the last few centuries. From there, I proceed to specify some key empirical areas that an inter-civilizational research agenda would examine, focussing on three types of politico-economic systems change: the rise of capitalism, the rise and development of globalization, and changes in the distribution of structural power within the world economy. I close that section by pointing to various smaller-scale areas of research that derive from what I call everyday inter-civilizational political economy. And I conclude by considering some of the key methodological and substantive issues that my own non-Eurocentric research approach throws up.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS; BRITISH";
AB;On the occasion of the Review of International Political Economy's 20th anniversary, this paper systematically assesses RIPE's claim to represent an alternative to the mainstream' study of international political economy (IPE) with several new sources of evidence. The first is the IPE component of a 20-country survey of international relations (IR) faculty, the second a database of books in the field. The third, and most important, is derived from coding 326 RIPE articles published 2000-10 to discover key cleavages and trends. These results are compared with those from prior studies of the 12 IR journals identified as the leading' journals by the Teaching, Research and International Politics (TRIP) project. The article concentrates on five key issues: paradigmatic orientation, epistemology, methodology, policy orientation, and demography. The results provide ground for scepticism that the American School' of IPE does or will define the mainstream. The findings further tend to confirm that RIPE has stayed relatively true to its founders' intentions in representing diversity in the global study of IPE.;

AB;Although the meltdown in the American financial system in 2008 created the most profound financial crisis in sixty years, the field of International Political Economy (IPE) has remained curiously silent. More worrisome is the inability of the paradigmatic approach to the study of IPE in the United States - Open Economy Politics (OEP) - to shed much light on the causes of the crisis. We develop the conceptual distinction between risk and uncertainty to explain why the rationalist (and largely materialist) American School of IPE failed so badly. OEP followed orthodox economics in conflating risk and uncertainty. Preserving the distinction, as constructivist IPE scholars and economic sociologists have done, enables us view the crisis through dual rationalist and sociological optics. Our illustrative evidence, drawn from public (the Federal Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve) and private actors (accountants, credit rating agencies, and arbitrage traders) in financial markets, shows that only eclectic approaches that make use of both rationalist and sociological optics give IPE scholars the depth of vision and the breadth of imagination necessary to make sense of the financial crisis of 2008.;

AB;Most descriptions of the spread of neoliberal economic policies since the 1980s overlook the significant contribution of international organizations not only to the dissemination of these policies, but also to their making. The scholarship often regards international organizations as passive transmission belts that merely comply with the demands of their member-states. Scholars who do identify the constitutive role of international organizations consider them to be enthusiastic supporters of the neoliberal project. There were cases, however, when international organizations were opposed to neoliberal reforms imposed from above. This paper draws on the experience of the World Health Organization (WHO) to show that in the process of adapting to the emerging neoliberal regime, international bureaucracies actively restructured this regime in accordance with their own institutional cultures. Some neoliberal prescriptions were successfully transmitted, but others were transformed, with the result that the global regime was hardly monolithic and included elements that were introduced by the international bureaucracies themselves. In developing this argument, the paper identifies the adaptive strategies that allow international bureaucracies, in spite of their vulnerability to external forces, to incorporate their own organizational agendas into what has consequently become a more heterogeneous global neoliberal regime.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"International organizations; structural adjustment; World Bank; International Development Association; mission creep; budget maximization";
AB;Although the impact of World Bank and IMF structural adjustment loans on developing country borrowers has been the subject of considerable analysis, our understanding of the origins of these operations remains poor. This article rectifies this deficiency by providing an account of the genesis of the Bank's program of structural adjustment. Drawing on documents from the Bank's archives as well as interviews with former Bank officials, the paper argues that the creation of structural adjustment lending in 1980 resulted from frustration among the Bank's senior management at the slow disbursement of the organization's regular project loans. Rather than a reaction to demands from powerful states, as many observers have assumed, structural adjustment was an internally driven response to flaws in the Bank's operations. In emphasizing the Bank's autonomy, this article supplements approaches that emphasize the importance of budget maximization and mission creep as determinants of international organization behavior.;

AB;This article aims to better understand the discrepancy between a relatively high level of awareness of the ecological crisis on the one hand, and insufficient political and social change on the other. This discrepancy causes a crisis of what we call the Rio model of politics'. We approach the problem from the perspective of the concept of societal nature relations' (gesellschaftliche naturverhaltnisse), which can be situated in the framework of political ecology and, in this article, is combined with insights from regulation theory and critical state theory. The empirical analysis identifies fossilist patterns of production and consumption as the heart of the problem. These patterns are deeply rooted in everyday and institutional practices as well as societal orientations in the global North and imply a disproportionate claim on global resources, sinks and labour power. They thus form the basis of what we call the imperial mode of living' of the global North. With the rapid industrialisation of countries such as India and China, fossilist patterns of production and consumption are generalised. As a consequence, the ability of developed capitalism to fix its environmental contradictions through the externalisation of its socio-ecological costs is put into question. Geopolitical and economic tensions increase and result in a crisis of international environmental governance. Strategies like green economy' have to be understood as attempts to make the ecological contradictions of capitalism processable once again.;

AB;Since intellectual property rights (IPRs) and services were introduced to the international trade regime, state regulation on development sensitive issues such as access to education and medicines is directly affected by multilateral and bilateral trade agreements. By adopting a global governance analytical approach to trade politics and a comparative research strategy, the article shows, on the one hand, how national positions on trade in education and IPR have been defined, coordinated and contested in developing contexts and, on the other, the implications of these trade policies on a range of scales. Case studies in Argentina, Peru, Chile and Ecuador will enable us to discuss, on the grounds of extensive primary empirical data, how the apparent conflict between development and liberalization principles is being managed in free trade agreements in Southern countries, and with what outcomes.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Dollar; euro; international currency";
ID;"OF-PAYMENTS CRISES; MONEY; EXCHANGE; STRATEGIES; REGIMES; WORLD; STATE; POWER";
AB;This paper suggests that the dollar is not threatened as the hegemonic international currency, and that most analysts are incapable of understanding the resilience of the dollar, not only because they ignore the theories of monetary hegemonic stability or what, more recently, has been termed the geography of money, but also as a result of an incomplete understanding of what a monetary hegemon does. The paper argues that the dominant view on the international position of the dollar has been based on a Metallist view of money. In the alternative Cartalist view of money, the hegemon is not required to maintain credible macroeconomic policies (i.e., fiscally contractionary policies to maintain the value of the currency), but to provide an asset free of the risk of default. Further, it is argued that the current crisis in Europe shows why the euro is not a real contender for hegemony in the near future.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Autocracy; rush to free trade; trade and capital account liberalization; IMF surveillance power; Morocco; Tunisia; Egypt; Jordan";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL-MONETARY-FUND; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; POLICY; COUNTRIES; WORLD; IMF";
AB;This paper argues that within autocracies the beginning of IMF-friendly trade and capital account reforms is highly contingent on the ability of alternative policy regulations to provide respective regimes with domestically needed amounts of convertible foreign exchange. A longitudinal comparison of four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan) between the 1960s and the early 1990s in the Middle East and North Africa region shows a historical sequencing of reforms. Before the implementation of orthodox policy change, foreign exchange scarcity was managed primarily by rising restrictions, accumulation of debt and a number of unilateral country-specific strategies, including broader economic openings (infitah) and selective capital account liberalizations. However, IMF-friendly reforms only became a political option after the failure of these alternative policies and the simultaneous drying up of unconditional finance. These findings complement recent debates about the rush to free trade in at least two aspects. First, they point to distinct causal mechanisms depending on the type of political regime (e.g., autocracy versus democracy), explaining the beginning of trade and capital account liberalizations among developing nations. They specify, second, one important contextual condition in regard to the effectiveness of IMF surveillance power.;

DE;"Credit rating agencies; European Union; risk and uncertainty; sovereign debt crisis; financial governance; performativity";
ID;MARKET;
AB;As member states struggle to retain the investment grades necessary to allow them to finance their governmental operations at a reasonable cost, credit rating agencies (CRAs) have been blamed for exacerbating a procyclical bias which only makes this task more difficult. How CRAs contribute to the constitution of the politics of limits underpinning the European sovereign debt crisis is at the core of this article. As a socio-technical device of control, sovereign ratings are an illocutionary' statement about budgetary health, which promotes an artificial fiscal normality. Subsequently, these austere politics of creditworthiness have perlocutionary' effects, which seek to censure political discretion through normalizing risk techniques aligned with the self-systemic, and thereby self-regulating, logic of Anglo-American versions of capitalism. The ensuing antagonistic relationship between the programmatic/expertise and operational/politics dimensions of fiscal governance leaves Europe vulnerable to crisis and the renegotiation of how the political' is established in the economy. New regulatory technical standards (RTS) can exacerbated the performative effects on CRAs, investors and member states.;

AB;Compared to the US, the European Union is often depicted as having adopted a soft' approach to intellectual property rights (IPRs), despite the substantial role it has played in the ratcheting up of IPR standards. This article counters this view by showing how competitiveness' discourses from the late 1970s onwards have legitimised a more = better' IP strategy both within and without Europe. By revisiting how earlier concerns about European competitiveness did not trigger a similarly expansionist IP strategy, the argument is made that the relationship between enhanced IP protection and improved European competitiveness is a political and discursive relationship that is ridden with inconsistencies - a relationship that can and should be formulated differently.;

ID;"CAPITAL ACCOUNT LIBERALIZATION; EMERGING MARKETS; LATIN-AMERICA; COST APPROACH; ECONOMY; INTERMEDIATION; INDONESIA; MEXICO; INSTITUTIONS; SECTOR";
AB;This paper examines the domestic politics of financial internationalization. Financial internationalization has two components, the liberalization of cross-border capital flows and the liberalization of foreign ownership restrictions, yet most research to date has concentrated exclusively on the former. Building on existing theoretical work, this paper argues that in the developing world, domestic finance favors the joint abolition of restrictions on the inflow of foreign capital alongside continued restrictions on the ability of foreigners to own and operate domestic financial institutions. I test the argument on a unique dataset of foreign entry restrictions in developing economies and by examining interest group pressures for financial internationalization in Indonesia and Mexico. The findings complement and extend recent work on financial internationalization in the developing world and suggest further areas for research in the role of domestic interest group preferences for global economic integration.;

AB;Who is watching the financial services industry? Since 1980, there have been multiple waves of thought about whether the ministry of finance, the central bank, a specialized regulator or some combination of these should have supervisory authority. These waves have been associated with the convergence of actual practices. How much and through what channels did internationally promoted ideas about supervisory best practice' influence institutional design choices? I use a new dataset of 83 countries and jurisdictions between the 1980s and 2007 to examine the diffusion of supervisory ideas. With this data, I employ Cox Proportional Hazard and Competing Risks Event History Analyses to evaluate the possible causal roles best practice policy ideas might have played. I find that banking crises and certain peer groups can encourage policy convergence on heavily promoted ideas.;

ID;"ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS; EUROPEAN-UNION; COOPERATION; POLITICS; END";
AB;Theories and analyses of regionalism, from both orthodox' and critical' strands of international political economy (IPE), have tended to conceptualise regional integration as a process led by intra-regional actors typically in reaction to external forces such as globalisation and the hegemonic power of international actors. This article sheds new light on theories of regionalism by arguing that international actors can have a direct and significant influence on the dynamics of regionalism, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, by examining the influence of the European Union (EU) on the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Building on the recent literature on Africa and international relations, which shows how lines of sovereignty between domestic and international actors are blurred in the case of African political economies, the article shows how the EU played a significant role in the SADC's inception and has been directly influential in shaping the SADC's strategies and priorities in the post-Lome period. In the latter instance, this article explains how the EU's institutional embeddedness in the SADC's aid structures and its asymmetrical bargaining power in the SADC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) has encouraged the SADC's pursuit of a neoliberal, trade-oriented form of regionalism.;

AB;This paper is the culmination of a multi-country, multi-method investigation into the export effects of Aid for Trade (AfT). Building on previous single-donor statistical studies of AfT, this paper conducts a statistical study of 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) AfT donors and then examines the delivery and implementation of AfT in four recipient countries - Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and Vietnam - from four donor countries - Germany, Japan, Norway and the US. The paper finds considerable variation in the export effects of the AfT programs, ranging from programs with no impact on recipient country exports to programs that are positively correlated with recipient country exports to the donor country and/or the rest of the world. Taking a closer look at the AfT programs of Germany, Japan, Norway and the US suggests that differences in program design and implementation may account for differences in AfT export effects.;

ID;"FINANCIAL CRISIS; LIBERALIZATION; GLOBALIZATION; EUROPE";
AB;This article argues that the causes of the crisis in Romania and other new EU member states were different from those affecting Western Europe or the US. The main argument of this paper is that bad domestic monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies were the real crisis generators, while exogenous crisis mechanisms, including contagion from the global financial crisis, were just the trigger. Romania, and other new EU member states, has been facing the crisis of a consumption-led development model, not just a financial crisis imported from more developed economies. This paper brings insights into the impact of the flat-tax regime on consumption and the impact of speculative capital inflows disguised as foreign direct investments.;

AB;"Although the energy trade is the single most important element of nearly all European countries' relations with Russia, Europe has been divided by both worldview and practice. Why, in the face of the common challenge of dependence on imported Russian gas, have national reactions to such vulnerability varied so dramatically across the continent? And why have a handful of French, German, and Italian corporations somehow taken responsibility for formulating the energy strategy and thus the Russia policy for essentially all of Europe? The resolutions of these two puzzles are, I show, interlinked; they also demand theoretical innovation. With several case studies of Gazprom's decision-making during the 2006 and 2009 gas crises, and of the response of western and central Europe to their gas dependence I find that: firms are driving these political outcomes; those firms are motivated by profits but employ sociological conventions along their ways; and firms generally seek the necessary inter-firm, cross-border cooperation that will deliver corporate performance. Finally, I conclude that the field will ultimately require a framework that puts firms at its center.";

AB;A rich literature has emerged on the causes and consequences of international capital mobility (ICM). Yet much of this literature typically depicts ICM as a brute fact one which possesses an unproblematic logic to which actors respond automatically across time and space. We challenge this depiction and argue that in large part, how you stand on ICM depends on how it is collectively seen as a consequence of empirically and contextually variable intersubjectively shared beliefs, or social facts. We therefore argue that researchers that fail to take social facts seriously run the risk of making unwarranted causal inferences and less effective policy recommendations. We advance the literature by specifying how the ontological novelty of a social facts perspective generates unique insights into key political economy questions concerning the causes and consequences of ICM. We develop an agent-centered perspective that stresses ideational contestation as a key area of analysis for those that take social facts seriously. We push forward this agent-centered perspective by outlining a set of features that winning ideas are likely to display. We then conclude by specifying an agenda for future research and opportunities for bridge-building among various perspectives on ICM.;

ID;INTERNATIONAL-TRADE;
AB;"While the effects of cultural disparity and common institutional foundations on international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) have been much analyzed, little analysis of languages' transaction costs has been done in either the international relations or international business literatures. This paper integrates literature from international political economy, international business and economics, and linguistics, to examine the transaction costs of languages under three different measures of language closeness, same language, direct communication, and language distance. Language is both a tool in international economic transactions and a vehicle to transmit cultural values, but our results point out that major trade languages are employed differently in international trade and in FDI. Communication costs, for both FDI and international trade, show a hierarchy, with English the most inexpensive among major trade languages. We introduce the concept of language intensity to explain why communication costs are much more important in FDI than in international trade. Major trade languages may obtain considerable power from their economic use; we examine the asymmetric nature of this power. We empirically test these ideas in gravity equation models.";

ID;"REGIONALISM; AMERICA";
AB;Mercosur faces a number of challenges in furthering its regional integration. This article considers whether theories developed for European regionalism, such as neo-functionalism and liberal inter-governmentalism, provide a suitable framework for analysing the Mercosur case. The article argues that economic and policy asymmetries as well as institutional, social and economic deficits hamper deepening regionalism. These asymmetries and deficits also jeopardise the further benefits that could arise from building on Mercosur's considerable achievements. Finally, the analysis warns against the dangers of politicisation of Mercosur and the importance of societal inclusion. It suggests that top-down state-led Mercosur regionalism could benefit from being turned upside-down by bottom-up societal interest in deeper integration in the current shifting international economic context.;

ID;"STATE-LED TRANSNATIONALISM; LATIN-AMERICA; SOUTH-AMERICA; GOVERNANCE; AGENDA";
AB;"The negotiation of migration issues within the Latin American Southern Cone Market (Mercosur) has gained momentum lately and has followed a specific (relatively autonomous and fast) dynamic that is unprecedented and contrasts with the slow and conflictive negotiations to achieve the bloc's economic goals. This study explains why negotiations to harmonize migration policies are taking place, why now, and how this is happening in a way that contradicts previous assumptions. It highlights a number of facts and explanatory factors largely neglected by the existing literature, such as: (1) instable political contexts in which social inequality, marginalization, and discontent call attention to socio-political issues and prompt state attempts to regulate human mobility cooperatively; (2) regional leadership that is not simply based on relative power and economic interests but on ideologically-loaded political projects and key actors who forge and legitimize a post-neoliberal consensus linking domestic and foreign policy strategies; (3) policy networks of private and public actors whose ideas inform top policy-makers discourses and contribute to the processes of socialization of policy elites, construction of shared understandings, and cultivation of cooperative practices that feed regional integration. The findings and conclusions shed light on the interplay between domestic politics and foreign policy, as well as the processes of coalition- and identity-building that are allowing South American governments to expand cooperation in a piecemeal and somewhat inconsistent fashion.";

ID;"STOCK-MARKET; CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY; VOLATILITY; COMMITMENT; MODELS; ELECTIONS; DEMOCRACY; RETURNS; DEBT; RISK";
AB;This article investigates how credible commitment evolves when sovereign states borrow jointly. In 2006, Venezuela and Argentina issued a package of joint' sovereign bonds, which were later tradable separately. Despite the fact that Venezuela did not explicitly guarantee the Argentine component of the bond, this paper shows through a series of GARCH models that the financial markets have traded the bond on the basis of news about Venezuela's politics, macro economy and its commitment to the bond and other regional integration projects. This is because the bond was embedded in a more extensive set of financial and political relationships between the two countries, and served as a commitment mechanism, enhancing Argentine credibility. The article demonstrates that bilateral economic and political relationships can serve as a credible commitment device in the absence of changes to domestic institutions or longer-term re-establishment of reputation.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DT;Article;
DE;"IPE; neoliberalism; nature; tourism; Thailand";
ID;"ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; THAILAND; ECOTOURISM; CAPITALISM";
AB;This paper examines the inter-relationships between neoliberalism, tourism and nature. It argues that scholars of international political economy (IPE) need to engage more fully with the role of nature in driving forward the logics of neoliberalism. Most scholars view nature as a source of accumulation or as an object of governance, but this paper uses the neoliberalisation of nature debate to extend our understandings of neoliberalism. In particular, global tourism has targeted and opened up new frontiers in nature, which serves to expand and deepen neoliberalism to a wider range of biophysical phenomena. This paper uses the case of elephant tourism to demonstrate how tourism is not just reflective of neoliberalism, but is in fact a key driver of it, acting as an environmental fix for capitalism. Further, this paper takes up the challenge of research on actually existing neoliberalisms' via engagement with locally specific contexts and emerging forms of socio-nature in the Thai tourism industry. It reveals how neoliberalism redraws the boundaries of access to nature, thereby shifting the distribution of costs and benefits. Hence, nature is one of the primary ways in which neoliberalism is constituted, albeit in a highly differentiated way. This reminds us not to reify neoliberalism and accord it a greater degree of power and coherence than it really has.;

TI;The material and symbolic construction of the BRICs: Reflections inspired by the RIPE Special Issue;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"BRICs; Washington consensus; financial markets; Eurozone crisis";
AB;In this short piece, I return to the articles in this special issue to examine the relationship between the material reality of the concept of BRICs and its symbolic place in the world economy today. Aside from the facts that the BRIC countries have been ready to depart from the Washington consensus on certain key elements (state intervention), while maintaining other aspects (fiscal discipline), there isn't much support for the notion that these countries somehow share specific development strategies. If anything, the papers in this special issue show that these four countries have rather different etiologies of growth. The notion of BRICs, I argue, is thus better apprehended through its symbolic and political dimensions, as an effort by well-placed actors in the financial markets to drum up excitement about investment opportunities, as well as reorient the governance structures of the world economy away from the traditional stronghold of Europe.;

AB;This paper explores the origins and trajectory of the Washington Consensus the ideas associated with the developing countries' move to free markets in the 1980s and 1990s. I argue that the Consensus was a transnational policy paradigm, shaped by both scholarly and political forces (Hall, 1993). At the core of the Consensus was the international financial institutions' practice of conditionality making loans to governments in exchange for policy reforms. The Consensus was subsequently weakened by its own unintended consequences, by political forces both within Washington and worldwide and by intellectual changes in the field of economics. However, I argue that the Consensus has yet to encounter any serious rivals.;

AB;Is Brazil's economic policy regime a mere tinkering of the Washington Consensus? The evidence suggests that Brazilian governments institutionalized a hybrid policy regime that layers economically liberal priorities originating in the Washington Consensus and more interventionist ones associated with neo-developmentalist thinking. To capture this hybridity, the study calls this regime liberal neo-developmentalism'. While defending the goal of macroeconomic stability and sidelining full employment, Brazilian governments also reduced reliance on foreign savings and employed a largely off-the-books stimulus package during the crisis. Brazil experienced important privatization, liberalization and deregulation reforms, but at the same time the state consolidated its role as owner and investor in industry and banking while using an open economy industrial policy and a cautious approach to the free movement of capital. Finally, while conditional cash transfers fit the Washington Consensus, Brazil's steady increases in the minimum wage, industrial policies targeted at high employment sectors and the use of state-owned firms to expand welfare and employment programs better fit a neo-developmentalist policy regime. In sum, while the main goals of the Washington Consensus were not replaced with neo-developmentalist ones, Brazil's policy regime saw an extensive transformation of policy orthodoxy that reflects Brazil's status as an emerging power.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Russia; neoliberalism; privatization; transition; shock therapy";
ID;"REFORM; POLICY";
AB;This article aims to assess the role of neoliberal ideas in shaping Russia's transition to a market economy. Prevailing ideas of the Washington Consensus undoubtedly encouraged Russia's leaders to embrace radical reforms, but Russia's reformers were not blindly following an ideological agenda set for them in Washington, DC. The actual policies that were implemented diverged considerably from the prevailing neoliberal orthodoxy and were heavily shaped by the self-interest of the elites who were making the policy decisions. While prices were freed and international trade and currency flows opened up, an insider-dominated privatization process left the Russian economy in the hands of a narrow circle of oligarchs. Russia's corrupt, oil-dependent and state-centered economy is far removed from the decentralized, competitive market system that the reformers had envisaged. Democracy, which was initially seen as integral to the transition process, also fell by the wayside. While critics argue that Russia suffered from an overdose of market fundamentalism', neoliberals themselves still insist that Russia did not go far enough in unleashing genuine market forces. Either way, Russia has now joined the global market economy, while at the same time preserving many of the institutional features that are the product of its unique geography and historical heritage.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"India; globalization; deregulation; political economy; institutional change";
ID;"WASHINGTON CONSENSUS; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; POLITICS; SEEKING";
AB;This paper makes the case for a tipping point' model for understanding economic change in India. This gradual and largely endogenously driven path calls for the simultaneous consideration of ideas and politics. Exogenous shocks affected economic policy, but did not determine the course of economic history in India. India's developmental model evolved out of new ideas Indian technocrats developed based on events they observed in India and other parts of the world. A historical case for the tipping point' model is made by comparing two severe balance of payments crises India faced in 1966 and 1991. In 1966, when the weight of ideas and politics in India favored state-led import substitution, Washington could not coerce New Delhi to accept deregulation and globalization. In 1991, on the other hand, when Indian technocrats' ideas favoured deregulation and globalization, the executivetechnocratic team engineered a silent revolution in the policy paradigm. New Delhi engaged constructively with Washington, making a virtue of the necessity of IMF conditions, and implemented a home-grown reform program that laid the foundations for rapid economic growth in world's most populous and tumultuous democracy.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"BRICs; Washington Consensus; Beijing Consensus; New Left; CCP; Chinese Communist Party; neoliberal";
ID;"STATE; MYTH";
AB;Has a Beijing Consensus emerged to challenge the Washington Consensus? If so, what is the essence of this alternative consensus and why does it matter? This article argues that efforts at a definitive description of a Chinese model of stateeconomy relations, especially as it compares to the original policy recommendations of the Washington Consensus, have and will continue to prove unsatisfying. This is because any such comparative exercise is inherently political and prone to various angles of critique. Instead, this article argues that it is precisely because of the politics of such comparison that competing and often contradictory portrayals of a Beijing Consensus or China Model have taken on importance inside and outside of China. This article further argues that western accounts of a Beijing Consensus or China Model alternative to the Washington Consensus too often ignore or minimize the contentious debates within China about how best to describe Chinese economic governance. This study, in contrast, seeks to understand China's relationship to the Washington Consensus by exploring how concepts like the Beijing Consensus or China Model are deployed and contested outside and inside of China. The article concludes by offering suggestions for further research on the domestic Chinese and international policy implications of debates about the Beijing Consensus.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Anti-Americanism; China; financial crisis; globalization; Obama; United States";
AB;"The financial crisis that erupted in September 2008 seemed to confirm all the worst stereotypes about the United States held abroad: that Americans are bold, greedy, and selfish to excess; that they are hypocrites, staunch defenders of the free market ready to bail out their own companies; and that the US has long been the architect and primary beneficiary of the global economic system. So the crisis had an enormous potential for deteriorating further the global image of the United States, already at an all-time high during the George W. Bush era. Yet anti-American sentiments did not surge worldwide as a result of the crisis, neither at the level of public opinion, nor at the level of actions and policy responses by foreign policy-makers. This article explains why the dog did not bark and reawaken anti-Americanism in the process. The central argument is that this potential anti-Americanism has been mitigated by several factors, including the election of Obama, the new face of globalization, and the perception of the relative decline of US power coupled with the rise of China, which suggests that the post-American world may be accompanied by a post anti-American world, at least in Europe.";

AB;This paper claims that investors dislike political uncertainty about future policies and value stability in the political environment. We test the validity of this hypothesis by first studying variations in equity flows from global investment funds to emerging markets in periods surrounding elections. Second, we interpret changes in democracy score as another event potentially creating political uncertainty and assess their effects on equity flows. Our results corroborate our hypothesis. They indicate that the period following an election is generally characterized by a fall in equity flows, and that this occurs only where the incumbent is not re-elected, suggesting continuity is valued by investors. We also find that this effect is confined to presidential regimes, a result we interpret as further evidence that potentially radical swings in policy affect investors choices. Finally, a decrease in the democracy score implies lower equity flows, while democracy in itself does not affect equity flows, which is consistent with our view that equity funds are vigilant when potentially adverse changes in the political environment arise.;

AB;Following the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) intellectual property rights, and more specifically copyright, have become the subject of highly politicized conflicts. In this paper we analyze how these conflicts shifted from the political arena to private standard-setting sites, where two opposing coalitions of actors pursued competing initiatives an industry coalition which aimed at enforcing copyright protection through Digital Rights Management and an emerging coalition of civil society actors which sought to develop a digital commons based on copyleft licenses. Paradoxically, the industry coalition, which had very successfully lobbied international organizations, ran into trouble developing and enforcing private regulation in the market place, while the civil society coalition proved to be more effective in the market than in the political sphere. The findings of our analysis indicate that the strategic use of organizational forms and collective action frames can be more decisive for the mobilization of users than material resources, and that the success of collective action frames depends on their compatibility with user practices. Based on the argument that regime shifting from intergovernmental to private governance can open up new and favorable spaces for weak actors to experiment with alternative forms of regulation, the paper contributes to the literature on the politics of regime complexity. The paper furthermore highlights the importance of studying non-elite actors and their day-to-day practices to gain a better understanding of changes within the international political economy.;

In this paper we examine the political economy within which the Diaspora option has emerged and the broader implications of the discursive and material ways that migrants are being incorporated as professionalized partners in development. Drawing on a case study of the World Bank's Africa Diaspora Program we examine the underlying assumptions, ideologies and silences upon which this policy option rests. We conclude that the emerging Diaspora option should be approached more critically because the current celebration of these strategies obscures the selective and narrow neoliberal orientation; the assumptions that they make about the nature of diasporic engagement, and their increasing reliance on migrant populations to shoulder the investment risks associated with social transformation.";

DT;Article;
DE;"Global governance; business; intellectual property; pharmaceutical industry";
ID;"COUNTERFEIT DRUGS; COUNTRIES; CONFUSION; MARKETS; POLICY; POWER";
AB;Most existing studies on the role of business in global governance conceive of business as one group acting vis-a-vis the state or NGOs. This article highlights that conflicts within the business community can be an important factor to explain policy outcomes. Drawing on the business conflict school literature from International Relations, studies on the politics of markets developed in Economic Sociology, and work on corporate political strategy undertaken in Management Studies, it develops the concept of the governance-competitiveness nexus to theorize how economic competition translates into political competition. The article demonstrates how such an analytical angle can add to our understanding of the global governance of intellectual property rights for pharmaceuticals. It helps explain the motives of different actors to become politically involved at specific points in time and the policy goals they promoted. Thus, the concepts of business conflict and governance-competitiveness nexus help explain the agenda setting process on global pharmaceutical IP governance.;

AB;Rapidly expanding world fruiticulture markets provide developing country producers with new income opportunities and much development literature and policy is orientated towards facilitating export production in these countries. However, it has been widely observed that the global retail revolution is accelerating the exclusion of small producers from export markets and (increasingly) from many domestic retail chains due to rising entry barriers. Small producers are thus often only able to sell their produce on to relatively low price traditional markets. This paper is based on data collected from a recently emerged fruiticulture sector in north-east Brazil. It shows that (a) export fruiticulture does generate significant economic benefits, (b) that modern domestic retail markets are increasingly demanding and exclusionary, but also, and counter to much of the literature concerned with export promotion, that (c) small-farms producing fruiticulture products for traditional domestic markets do generate positive local economic impacts. Policymakers should, therefore, consider new ways of assisting smaller producers to enter these markets.;

TI;Reframing the euro vs. dollar debate through the perceptions of financial elites in key dollar-holding countries;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Currency; dollar; euro; power; geopolitics; foreign; reserves";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES; POWER; POLITICS; FUTURE; WILL";
AB;This paper proposes a theoretically-informed and empirically-grounded cognitive approach to analyse how financial elites from China, the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Brazil interpret the euro vs. dollar debate. At the theoretical level, we argue that the debate should be reframed in order to capture not only the material, but also the ideational footprint of the euro, as well as to better conceptualise change in the International Monetary System (IMS). Our empirical work shows that the euro is perceived by financial elites as a useful diversification tool to avoid over-exposure to dollar weaknesses. However, despite its appeal as a valuable investment alternative, the European currency has a series of structural flaws that prevent it from substituting the dollar as the main international currency. Therefore, in purely material terms, the euro-sceptical literature is correct. However, we also find that the hitherto material inroads of the euro, while limited, have been sufficient to ideationally convince these elites that a multicurrency IMS is possible and might be more stable (and therefore preferable) to current dollar unipolarity. Therefore, the euro-optimist literature is far from wrong when it argues that the creation of the euro represents a challenge to the greenback, for it could be a stepping stone towards the formation of a multipolar IMS.;

DE;"Intellectual property; WIPO; development; framing; sociological institutionalism; institutional contradictions";
ID;"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ORGANIZATIONS; POLITICS; INSTITUTIONALISM; TRANSFORMATION; NETWORKS; POWER";
AB;This article takes as its starting point the emergence of the so-called Development Agenda at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 2004. It seeks to provide a diachronic view of the origins of the Agenda that goes beyond understanding it simply as an effort by some developing countries and civil society actors to bring about organisational change at WIPO. Building upon insights from sociological institutionalism, it argues that the Development Agenda is the manifestation of a founding contradiction in the institution of intellectual property itself, which has been the source of a great number of conflicts throughout its history. Actors involved in them have often used frames in an effort to legitimise their actions, such as the frame of development in the case of the Agenda. After exploring the development frame, the article concludes by arguing that the Agenda is likely to bring about only incremental changes, rather than transcend the tensions that helped bring it about.;

AB;This paper traces the recent evolution of North American economic and security relations within the context of broader debates in international political economy (IPE) concerning globalization and its effects on the state in the international system. Borrowing from David Lake's discussion of hierarchical sovereignty, this paper argues that efforts to meld security to economics in an integrated North American market devoid of institutions have made sovereignty more hierarchical. It presents an approach to looking at North American integration, which can assist in understanding recent developments that are suggestive of new areas of research and policy development for both practitioners and theoreticians.;

AB;How does the transnationalization of markets shape institution building, particularly in those countries that have few options other than to incorporate the rules and norms promulgated by advanced industrialized countries? Building on recent advances in international and comparative political economy, we propose a framework for the comparative study of the ways in which transnational integration regimes (TIRs) shape the development of regulatory institutions in emerging market democracies. The ability of TIRs to alleviate the supply and demand problems of institutional change in these countries depends in large part on the ways in which TIRs translate their purpose and power into institutional goals, assistance and monitoring. Integration modes can be combined in different ways so as to empower or limit the participation of a variety of domestic public and private actors to pursue and contest alternative institutional experiments. We illustrate the use of our framework via a brief comparison of the impact of the European Union accession process on post-communist countries and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Mexico, with special attention to the development of food safety regulatory institutions.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Czech Republic; Slovakia; Eurozone; legitimising discourses; economic and monetary integration";
ID;"ECONOMIC-REFORM; POSTCOMMUNIST EUROPE; NEO-LIBERALISM; IDENTITY; IDEAS";
AB;Despite their common history, the countries of the former Czechoslovakia appear to have adopted markedly different policies towards Eurozone accession. Whereas Slovakia joined the common currency in January 2009 the Czech Republic has adopted a more sceptical attitude with the question of Euro adoption postponed indefinitely. Given the relative similarities of the two states' institutional apparatuses and economic structures it is unsurprising that standard accounts of monetary policymaking struggle to explain the divergence in attitudes towards the EMU. This article presents a constructivist understanding of the politics of Eurozone accession strategies by focusing on the role of legitimising discourses in the political process. These are conceptualised as the historically-informed sum total of inter-subjectively held beliefs held by elites and masses within a particular political system. By focusing on the ideational aspects of Euro adoption we are able to understand how each country's early experience with EU accession fed into differing perceptions of national purpose and the relative importance of European integration. Whereas the Czech Republic increasingly favoured greater national assertion and policy independence, Slovakia came to understand Eurozone membership as an important tool in reversing the feelings of isolationism experienced during the Meciar period. A focus on these competing discourses helps us to understand the divergence in Euro-adoption strategies and in turn serves to enrich the debate on EU economic and monetary integration by highlighting the limitations of rationalist analyses.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Energy; pipelines; resource nationalism; credible commitments; Russia; Eurasia";
ID;"WAR; INTERDEPENDENCE; INSTITUTIONS; CREDIBILITY; LESSONS; PEACE; COSTS; OIL";
AB;The resurgence of Russia's energy diplomacy animates debate among realists, who regard pipelines as instruments of competitive resource nationalism, and their critics, who treat them either as mechanisms for strengthening cooperation or reflecting obsolescing bargains that empower transit states upon construction and operation. Yet, this debate conspicuously overlooks the variable record of the arbitrary disruption of Eurasian energy transit. This article addresses these oversights by explicating pipeline politics as an international credible commitment problem. It focuses specifically on the different incentives among producer, consumer and transit states and on how insights into the economic and institutional dimensions of bargaining shape the value, risks and capacity of the parties to forge and uphold pipeline agreements. Accordingly, arbitrary disruption is more likely under conditions in which the primary stakeholders are not preoccupied by recouping returns on investment and face incentives to gamble on new terms, as well as operate within opaque national regulatory settings. Credible commitments to uphold cross-border transit arrangements are more likely when the opposite conditions obtain. These claims are probed in comparative cases of arbitrary interruption of Soviet legacy pipelines and curious non-events in Eurasian oil and gas transit.;

AB;A large literature in international political economy views individuals trade policy preferences as a function of the income effects of economic openness. We argue that the expected environmental consequences of free trade play a noteworthy role for protectionist attitudes that has not been noted so far. We use unique Swiss survey data that contain measures of individuals environmental concerns and different aspects of trade policy preferences to examine whether those who are more concerned about the environment also hold more protectionist trade policy preferences. Our results support this expectation. Individuals who are more concerned about the environment tend to think that globalization has more negative than positive effects, more strongly support jobs-related protectionism, and place more emphasis on aspects that go beyond price and quality when evaluating foreign products. Our results suggest that also the expected environmental consequences of free trade matter for trade policy preferences and not just the potential effects on the domestic wage distribution.;

ID;"OF-INDEPENDENT-STATES; EUROPE; REGIONALISM; ASIA; EU";
AB;This paper focuses on post-Soviet regional integration as a special case where integration projects are established by countries that originally comprised a single political entity after its collapse. It shows that in this framework the existing economic ties between countries are likely to affect adversely the interest of functional bureaucracy to support regional integration given that cutting existing connections is often more promising from the point of view of the budget expansion. Hence, the interaction of national and supranational bureaucracies is unlikely to generate impetus for increasing regional cooperation, which, surprisingly, can, however, be supported by adverse economic shocks. The results are validated using the experience of two low-level politics sectors of interaction in the post-Soviet space: electricity and transportation.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Science; world-systems; world polity; standards; technical barriers to trade; cotton";
ID;"WORLD POLITY; NETWORK; SCIENCE; SYSTEM";
AB;Science has been institutionalized as a legitimate basis for decision-making at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This raises a critical question: how does the scientization of decision-making shape the construction of new governance arrangements? Using the case of negotiations between the Chinese state and the US state over the harmonization of cotton quality classification, I consider three approaches to scientization in world politics: the world polity approach, the world-systems approach and the political sociology of science. Evidence from the case demonstrates the need to largely reject the world polity approach while integrating the world-systems approach with the finer-grained analyses of the political sociology of science. This analysis yields two key arguments regarding the implications of science-based decision-making as an institutionalized global norm. First, scientization can formalize existing power inequalities given the uneven historical terrain of research legacies. Second, as scientization channels politics through science, powerful actors are better situated to legitimate their own interests in scientific terms and to define what makes science legitimate.;

DE;"International aviation; European Union; United States; multi-level games; ambiguity; historical institutionalism";
ID;"POLITICS; INSTITUTIONS; COMMUNITY; POLICY";
AB;How can we explain an international agreement that appears to run counter to the declared objectives of one of the key players? This article examines the USEU Open Skies agreement signed in 2007 and asks why Europeans accepted the agreement after having rejected a comparable version three years earlier. Theoretical approaches that explain time inconsistency in international negotiations tend to focus on reasons why states can be constrained to accept suboptimal solutions. In multi-level bargaining, principalagent and bureaucratization theories focus on loss of control and constructivists suggest that governments can become trapped in rhetoric. This article shows that paradoxical agreements can be voluntary and explains them by showing the rationale behind multi-games that include ambiguity about the future. In particular, increasing the flexibility of the agreement allowed negotiators to escape present-day constituent pressures by remaining ambiguous and betting on shifting coalitions.;

AB;This paper theorizes about the new international financial architecture as a manifestation of the 'second face of neoliberalism' - financial market reregulation through technocratic obfuscation and insularity from democratic political pressure. Using a more expansive definition of the new international financial architecture, one that includes the institutional nexus of international monetary management along with the rules and regulatory bodies governing capital, this argument is developed through an analysis of the origins and functions of two institutions comprising the new international financial architecture - the Basel Capital Accord and the diffusion of inflation targeting regimes across central banks. This paper excavates the neoliberal logic inscribed in these institutions and further shows how these new forms of institutional logic contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by putting in place a set of opportunities and constraints that led to rapid growth in the market for asset-backed securities. The implications of this analysis for the future of regulatory reform are discussed, with particular attention paid to the question of what role central banks should play in this process.;

DE;"France; informal institutions; gift; financial crisis; capitalism; liberalization";
ID;"FINANCIAL CRISIS; TRANSFORMATION; SYSTEMS";
AB;France's plan de soutien bancaire was in many ways similar to other national rescue plans that were adopted in the context of the global financial crisis. Yet, the French plan stands out for its remarkably collective and conflict-free nature. In order to account for this distinctiveness, we highlight the role of an informal consortium among public and private actors in the French financial establishment. We argue that the bank support plan should be viewed as a gift that members of the same elite group extended to each other in exchange for future, albeit still indeterminate, counter-gifts. Thus, the presidential rhetoric of 'rupture', a hallmark of Nicolas Sarkozy's mandate (2007-2012), should not be taken at face value. Behind the scenes, a closed decision-making process brought together and strengthened a small group of high-powered public officials and bankers. The role of this consortium in shaping the bank rescue plan underscores its importance in France's evolving model of capitalism.;

AB;This article argues for a pluralist, integrative, 'post-Washington Consensus' view of an East Asian financial architecture in the post-global crisis world. What are the key architectural problems and how might such problems be resolved? The article aims to address these general questions and to develop a policy-applicable theory about a post-crisis regional financial architecture by focusing on the case of East Asia. The generic problems identified in the study include sovereignty, power struggles, structural diversity, collective action problems and weak regional identity and norms. Herein, I present a conceptual model of logically possible solutions to such problems, which comprises principled minimalism and host regulation, decomposition and issue linkage, and informal intermediaries. The proposed solutions reflect and reinforce the normative fragmentation and decentralization of global financial governance in the twenty-first century.;

TI;From failure to failure: The politics of international banking regulation;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Financial regulation; institutional theory; regulatory capture; historical institutionalism; Basel III; international political economy";
AB;It is now clear that Basel III, a much discussed set of proposals to govern the international banking system drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, has fallen far short of its creators' aims. Even more puzzlingly, this is not without precedent. Eleven years ago, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Basel Committee attempted to overhaul global banking rules in order to enhance the stability of the global financial system. The culmination of its five-year efforts, the Basel II Accord, was abandoned by regulators before ever being fully implemented. In this paper, I ask why Basel II failed to meet the Basel Committee's original objectives and why Basel III has met a similar fate. Drawing on recent work on the politics of global regulation, I present a theoretical framework which emphasizes the importance of timing and sequencing in determining the outcome of rule-making in global finance. The success of this framework in explaining the failure of Basel II and Basel III is an invitation to scholars in the field of International Relations to take 'time' seriously as an analytical variable.;

ID;"MONEY; GOVERNMENTALITY; TERRORISM; POLITICS; ECONOMY; STATES; WAR";
AB;While the end of the Bretton Woods system led to deregulation and increased international capital flows, the trend over the past two decades has been toward increased international financial supervision. Aspects for an emerging structure of global governance are congealing into a form of 'financial governmentality' as a means to secure society and to isolate criminal and terrorist money. Efforts to defend society from organised crime and transnational terrorism extend into financial services and introduce increased levels of surveillance over all forms of financial exchange. The paper begins with an explication for the power relations between international organisations (created by select states to manage and direct the global economy) and the non-member jurisdictions that are, in turn, subjected to their guidance. The experience of the Philippines with the international campaign against money laundering directed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is presented as a case study for the governmentality present in global financial governance. Initially the Philippine government sought to retain a measure of autonomous action while satisfying the FATF's demands for legislative change. The initial failure to meet the expectations of international standards impacted international financial flows to the Philippines, including migrant remittances. It was with this specific experience in mind that the government of the Philippines crafted new regulations to cover emerging technologies that facilitate money transfer via mobile phone, positioning the Philippines as the leader for this form of governance to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, this case represents an emerging practice for self-discipline by states seeking to demonstrate compliance with internationally produced standards and best practices for banking and finance.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Financial regulation; transnational lobbying; interest groups; regulatory capture; Basel Committee";
ID;"POLITICAL UNDERPINNINGS; FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE; CAPITAL RULES; CRISIS; POLICY; RISK; ECONOMY; LESSONS; POWER";
AB;Since the global financial crisis, scholars of international political economy (IPE) have increasingly relied on the concept of 'regulatory capture' to explain the weakness of regulatory oversight and, hence, regulatory failures. Yet despite the widespread use of the concept of regulatory capture, its precise mechanisms are not well understood. This paper empirically investigates this hypothesis by examining one important institution of global financial governance that has been subjected to intense private sector lobbying at the transnational level: the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Using extensive archival material as well as interviews with participants in the generation of the Basel II Capital Accord, I argue that while private sector lobbyists had unprecedented access to the regulatory policymaking process, this access did not always translate into influence. Furthermore, when influence was present, it sometimes had the effect of increasing regulatory stringency, rather than weakening regulation. As such, I argue that our understanding of the process of transnational policy formation would benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the contingency of private sector 'influence' over the regulatory process, rather than the extensive, all-or-nothing depiction of regulatory 'capture' that currently prevails within the IPE literature.;

Europe's daring monetary experiment, we are told, is doomed to end in spectacular failure. For others, by contrast, the outcome ultimately will be not less union but ""more Europe"" - an even tighter merger of national economic sovereignty. Tested by adversity, the euro will emerge more successful than ever. Who is right? The correct answer is: Neither. Skeptics are wrong because they underestimate Europe's deep political commitment to the euro's survival, in some form or other. Euro-enthusiasts are wrong because they overestimate the amount of ""give"" in Europe's domestic politics. The euro will neither fail nor succeed. Defective but defended, it will simply endure.";

DE;"Capitalization; green economy; energy; peak oil; global warming; power theory of value";
ID;DIFFERENTIAL ACCUMULATION;
AB;Liberal capitalist polities are being held up as the ultimate civilizational achievement precisely at a point in time when the energy-demanding built environments and growth imperatives of these societies are threatened by global climate change and the coming end of cheap and abundant carbon energy. Throughout the twentieth century, this pattern of energy-intensive social reproduction was largely shaped by the oil and gas sector creating what I call a petro-market civilization. However, given the challenges presented by peak oil and global warming, transitioning to a low-carbon or green energy future has gathered increasing attention and investment. In this paper, I use a power theory of value approach to offer a preliminary assessment of whether this transition is likely given the entrenched power of the oil and gas sector in the economy. Although the twenty-first century may bear witness to a renewable and sustainable energy paradigm, current evidence suggests that investors are continuing to capitalize an unsustainable future premised upon non-renewable fossil fuels.;

ID;"GLOBAL FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE; WORLD-BANK; ARCHITECTURE; INSTITUTIONS; STANDARDS; EQUALITY; HEGEMONY; POLITICS; CRISIS; LIMITS";
AB;This article seeks to outline and explore some of the conditions necessary for International Organizations (IOs) to perform in a public interest fashion through a case study of the Principles of corporate governance formulated by the OECD. Rather than the more commonly documented pathological and dysfunctional behavioural forms of IOs, the case of the Principles, both in their formulation by the OECD, and in their assessment by the World Bank through the ROSC process, represent an episode of IO agency protecting and promoting a wider public interest. In exercising their agency, IO staff, have made the Principles more agreeable to a wider range of interested parties, giving them a general interest orientation, in accordance with a proceduralist definition of public interest. This case should therefore encourage IPE scholars to consider carefully and systematically the sets of circumstances and conditions, which might be required for IO agency to take more socially useful forms. In the final section, three indicators are identified which might be evaluated in future research into the positive public interest agency of IOs across a range of cases.;

AB;Quantitative assessments of 'country risk' produced by private rating agencies have become influential among multinational firms considering investment in the developing world. This article considers whether developing countries exhibiting more labour rights violations are associated with higher risk ratings. It draws from existing literature on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the relationship between labour rights and FDI to illuminate the ways in which labour repression may indicate increased risk for potential investors. It implements a set of time series of cross-sections models for 95 developing countries, from 1985 to 2003. These models present predictors of a long-established risk index, plus an additional latent risk measure created through factor analysis of three separate and distinct risk ratings. Results indicate a consistent association between increased labour rights violations and increased risk ratings. The article extends the analysis to highlight the heterogeneous nature of FDI and possible sector-specific relationships between labour rights and risk ratings. The paper argues that the economic profile of a country may condition the relationship between labour rights and risk ratings.;

AB;In less developed countries, the higher individuals' labor skills are, the more they support free trade. This recurrent statistical finding is problematic for extant analytical models used to explain and interpret people's positions on free trade. This article proposes an analytical framework that challenges the dominant full-information factor-endowment approach to public opinion on free trade. The dominant approach assumes informed individuals who relate expectations about how free trade will affect them to their work skills. We propose that most individuals lack information and that their positions reflect the influence of information, frames, economic vulnerability, and political endorsements. We test this alternative approach with a Spanish survey conducted in May 2009 and the ISSP survey conducted in 2003 in a large number of less developed and more developed countries. The Spanish data demonstrate that the population is largely uninformed and that their ideas about the consequences of free trade do not explain contrasts among different socio-demographic groups. Meanwhile, the ISSP data contradict important aspects of the traditional approach and are consistent our alternative approach.;

AB;"This article reassesses the neo-liberal shift within British economic policy-making and the international political economy, focusing especially the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1960s. The IMF has always used the conditions attached to its lending to try and shape borrower's policy; here we explore the evolving content of that conditionality and the economic ideas underpinning it. Using recently released IMF records, as well as other archives, we argue that the negotiations between the IMF and the UK Government in the 1960s can be seen as part of the Fund's drive towards a crucial change from discretionary to rules-based approaches to macroeconomic policy making. This drive took place within a struggle over a specific policy instrument, domestic credit expansion (DCE), at that time regarded as an important measure of monetary policy. The article locates the IMF advocacy of DCE within an attempt by the Fund to constrain discretionary policy-making through increasingly specific and binding rules. In response, UK Government officials began to pre-empt and even deceive the Fund to avoid being tied down. Our analysis unpacks which neo-liberal economic ideas the Fund embraced, noting its rejection of monetarism. In the period charted here (1965-69), the rules-based regime remained compatible with Keynesianism. However, the UK Government's grudging acceptance of this approach provided a crucial condition of possibility for a significant qualitative shift in macroeconomic policy-making when rules later became infused with an increasingly neo-liberal character.";

AB;In the past five years, the Chinese state has made great effort to implement its 'going-out' strategy, i.e., the geographical expansion of Chinese capital and labor overseas. This paper explores how the Chinese state rescales to implement this going-out strategy and produce new spaces of development. Particularly, this paper examines how the Chinese state reconfigures its institutional ensemble to integrate landlocked Yunnan Province into the transnational economy embodied in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The paper finds that the Chinese state deploys two spatial strategies - upward coordination with international organizations and GMS national governments, and downward implementation throughout Yunnan Province - to establish an interscalar regulatory regime. Through this regime the Chinese state aims to assemble capital, labor, and political clout to expand Chinese capital and labor in the GMS, and to develop Yunnan's economy to ease uneven domestic geographical development. This paper contributes to the booming literature on the political-economic restructuring of national states and to the limited scholarship on the institutional arrangement for cross-border regions in a non-Western context. It also sheds light on how the rescaling of the Chinese state potentially shapes the international political economy.;

The lead role of the US reflected its structural power in global finance and the influence of societal interests within the US concerned about the rapid growth of financial investment in agricultural derivatives markets over the past decade. Encouraged by market developments and deregulation in the United States, these investments represented a ""financialization"" of agriculture that was blamed for contributing for global food price volatility. In their push for tighter regulation, US domestic groups were able to boost their influence by allying with other domestic actors concerned about volatile energy prices and by linking their cause to the broader politics of financial reform in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. This episode has important lessons for the literatures analyzing the IPE of both food and finance.";

ID;"NORDIC COUNTRIES; GLOBALIZATION; CONFLICT; STRIKES; UNIONS";
AB;This article discusses public sector reform in North America and Western Europe. The argument is made that recent comparative literatures have yet to adequately consider governments themselves, and how changes to their budgeting, operation, and collective bargaining structures have affected jobs and income inequality. Drawing on a range of recent OECD and trade union statistics, as well as qualitative studies, it is claimed that governments converged substantially over period 1990-2005, introducing fiscal austerity measure and making substantive changes to public sector management and operation through privatization, marketization, and public-private partnerships. These substantially recast public sector industrial relations and led to job loss, labour market segmentation, and declining public sector labour power. This is the first study to report on comparative changes and qualitative reforms to fiscal policies, public sector services, and public sector labour forces in 13 OECD countries between 1980-2005.;

ID;"CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FACTORIES; STANDARDS; ORGANIZATION; GOVERNANCE; PROMISE; APPAREL; CONDUCT; CODES";
AB;Why do companies choose the private labour regulations that they do? Scholars know plenty about why companies might accept private regulators to oversee and protect labour standards. But they know very little about why companies choose one rather than another private regulatory approach when several are available, differing in terms of stringency. This paper explores the conditions under which companies in the clothing industry choose private labour-standards regulation with more rather than less stringent regulation. It does so based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of clothing companies in Europe. It argues that business preference for more stringent private labour regulation is positively affected by societal pressure, and that this societal pressure is predominantly orchestrated by activist groups. This not only entails campaigns, but also can be a combination of public and informal efforts to influence companies, together with pressures from consumers and media. This research also shows that national and industrial factors play a role. In particular, the position of the firm in the value chain and its distance to consumers and manufacturers affect preference for more or less stringent private regulation. Societal pressure is therefore important but not the only source of business preferences for private regulation.;

DE;"International organizations; World Bank; International Labour Organization; ideas; social policy; Africa";
ID;"WORLD BANKS; POLICY; PRIVATIZATION; IDEAS";
AB;Drawing on recent scholarship on transnational actors and on the role of ideas in policy change, this paper analyzes the regional context of the pension reform debate in Sub-Saharan Africa, and shows that, at least since the 1980s, there was significant attention to pension reforms in Africa by global policy actors, including the World Bank. However, unlike in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, where the World Bank proved dominant, the regional environment of pension reform in Sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by a fierce competition between the World Bank and the International Labour Organization (ILO), with each institution promoting different policy preferences. As demonstrated, in Sub-Saharan Africa pension reform, the ILO has proved more influential than the World Bank. Theoretically, the paper stresses the role of transnational actors in the global diffusion of social policy ideas. Recognizing the need to explore the interactions between national and transnational actors, as well as between transnational actors themselves, the analysis explores the dialogical and competitive nature of the global politics of ideas.;

AB;The World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the most judicialized dispute settlement systems in international politics. While a general appreciation has developed that the system has worked quite well, research has not paid sufficient attention to the weakest actors in the system. This paper addresses the puzzle of missing cases of least-developed countries initiating WTO dispute settlement procedures. It challenges the existing literature on developing countries in WTO dispute settlement which predominantly focuses on legal capacity and economic interests. The paper provides an argument that the small universe of 'actionable cases', the option of free riding and the assessment of the perceived opportunity costs related to other foreign policy priorities better explain the absence of cases. In addition (and somewhat counterintuitively), we argue that the absence of cases is not necessarily bad news and shows how the weakest actors can use the dispute settlement system in a 'lighter version' or in indirect ways. The argument is empirically assessed by conducting a case study on four West African cotton-producing countries (C4) and their involvement in dispute settlement.;

AB;The strengthening of central banks is frequently considered as a direct consequence of globalization. This paper offers an alternative explanation which considers this process as the result of political processes taking place first and foremost within local political fields. Yet we consider globalization as an important component in the politics of institutional reforms, by serving as a resource mobilized by political actors striving to improve their position in the local political field. We show how the central bank in Israel appealed to the normative power of worldwide accepted institutional models, to the authority of international financial organizations, and to the disciplinary power of global financial markets, claiming that the adoption of central bank independence is imposed by the imperatives of globalization. We claim that the ability of central banks to conduct a credible politics of inevitability is based on their privileged location as nexus between the global and local fields.;

ID;"WELFARE-STATE; INEQUALITY; POLITICS; GLOBALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; COUNTRIES; ECONOMY";
AB;"Arthur Okun famously argued that ""effciency is bought at the cost of inequalities in income and wealth"". Okun's trade-off represents the antithesis to Karl Polanyi's view of the relationship that the more embedded markets are in society, the better the social and economic outcomes they produce. This paper refines both these views. We argue that not all forms of market embeddedness are created equal, and that the relationship between equality and efficiency can be both positive and negative. We show this by examining how different ways of embedding economic activity in society through market regulation produce different combinations of efficiency and equality. We identify empirically three broad patterns: market liberal regulatory frameworks that promote competitive markets without decommodifying institutions; embedded liberal regulations that allow markets to work efficiently, but within the framework of decommodification and equality; and embedded illiberalism, where regulations hinder markets in favor of powerful social groups and where decommodification undermines both efficiency and equality. Okun's trade-off emerges as a special case limited to the English-speaking democracies: other OECD countries tend to exhibit either efficiency and equality together, or inefficiency and inequality together. These findings suggest a corrective to both naive market liberal views of the incompatibility of efficiency and equality, but also to the more sophisticated Varieties of Capitalism framework, which pays insufficient attention to the ways in which markets can be embedded in stable but apparently dysfunctional institutional arrangements.";

ID;"FEDERALISM; CHALLENGE";
AB;In the IPE literature, neoliberalism and nationalism have generally been portrayed as anti-thetical to one another. More recently, scholars have sought to challenge this binary view by examining how nationalists have employed neoliberal policies for nationalist reasons. However, while showing how neoliberal policies can be compatible with nationalist values, these approaches have not examined whether the reverse might also be true, whether certain nationalist policies (and discourses) might be genuinely compatible with neoliberal values. To address this gap in the literature, this paper makes two arguments. The first is that certain nationalist policies are not only compatible with neoliberal values, but that these values may actually be dependent on certain nationalist policies. The second argument made is that neoliberal nationalism may be on the rise due to a shift among social democratic forces from a broad strategy of economic nationalism to one of social democratic multilateralism. To demonstrate these points, the paper challenges the equation of neoliberalism with internationalism as well as showing why neoliberal nationalism is distinct from the nationalism of both populist and neoconservatives.;

AB;This paper advances an argument about the need to take into account two components of state-industry relations if we are to fully understand economic development and policy trajectory, as well as industry-state co-evolution. The first component, the specific structure of the bureaucracy and state-industry relations, has been the focus of intense research. However, the second, the particular industrial economic ideology defining the correct role of the state in industry and industry in a state, is at least as important, if under-researched. In order to do empirically advance the argument the paper merges a cognitive-based constructivist argument with a neo-developmental state structuralist one, to present a new understanding of the role of the state in the Irish miracle that explains not only its success and failures but its internal dissonances, such as the continuous discrimination of the local, Irish-owned, industry in favor of foreign-owned MNCs. The paper illustrates how a particular industrial economic ideology has been formed and crystallized in Ireland. Focusing on the IT industry and using a multimethod research strategy, it traces the influence and evolution of this ideology at five critical decision points over a fifty-year period.;

DE;"Exchange-rate politics; delayed devaluation; political economy of adjustment; policy preferences; political institutions; currency crisis";
ID;"EXCHANGE-RATE REGIMES; FINANCIAL CRISIS; CREDIBILITY; PREFERENCES; MIDDLE; RATES";
AB;When faced with speculative pressure on their currencies, policymakers often delay devaluations by spending billions of dollars in defense of a given exchange rate peg, only to succumb and devalue their currency later on. Using a political economy approach we argue that the interaction of distributional concerns, cognitive limitations, time-consistency problems, and institutional structures can keep governments from implementing the economically optimal policy response. We argue that distributional concerns often lead to a 'bias' in favor of currency defense as long as market pressures are mild. The political incentives to initially delay devaluations can be exacerbated by institutions that either increase the size of interest groups vulnerable to depreciation or give policymakers incentives to adopt a short time-horizon. Once market pressure becomes strong, however, the politically salient alternative to not depreciating becomes raising interest rates rather than just running down reserves. This acts as a wake-up call that changes perceptions of the underlying distributional considerations and hence the political trade-off between the costs and benefits of an exchange rate defense. As the coalition of devaluation-proponents grows, the likelihood of a devaluation increases. We illustrate our argument by discussing the salient distributional issues and their interaction with domestic institutions in four brief case studies.;

AB;In a world of rapid technological change and increasing interdependence between national and global networks, what institutions are necessary to facilitate the execution of a developmental project? An increasingly popular view expects the East Asian model of development to be ill-equipped to deal with the challenges involved in the information economy while the institutions of a 'developmental network state' are argued to be of greater utility. This paper tests this view in light of a dramatic shift in the business strategy of Korean firms in the telecommunications sector in the early years of the twenty-first century. I argue that core features of the Korean model have been recombined in creative and unanticipated ways to meet the twin challenges of economic openness and knowledge-based industrialisation. The argument is developed through an examination of the Korean government's promotion of a novel Korean-developed mobile broadcasting standard. I identify and trace the emergence of the institutional conditions which facilitated the rise of new and innovative forms of state-industry collaboration. The findings have implications for two outstanding issues in the developmental state literature: the role of former developmental states after liberalisation and the type of institutions useful beyond the catch-up process.;

AB;This article uses the concepts of critical juncture and feedback effects in historical institutionalism to examine China's role in promoting a China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA). The first section examines the specific combination of structural factors and key intervention from Chinese policymakers that triggered the CAFTA process. The second section outlines the details of the CAFTA negotiations, analyzing the feedback effects that shaped the path and eventual outcomes of the CAFTA Agreement. Attention is given to China's initiation of a programme of 'early harvest' agreements that were added to the CAFTA Agreement Framework in order to help persuade the hesitant states in the region to enlist in the China-led conception of Asian regionalism.;

ID;"INSTITUTIONS; THAILAND; POLICY";
AB;East Asian countries apply lower tariffs on their neighbors' products than they are required to under the various trade agreements to which they belong, a concession they grant only rarely to countries outside the region. The result is a de facto preferential trade area in East Asia in which applied tariff rates significantly undercut the legally bound rates. This gap, termed binding overhang, is an under-studied aspect of international political economy, but provides information about the nature of East Asian regionalism. To wit, the regional bias in applied tariffs is driven by transnational production networks that must move components across borders, not geopolitics or state preferences for increased regional integration. This finding supports a 'bottom up' interpretation of East Asian regionalism.;

AB;On 15 October 2008, CARIFORUM became the first region among the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries to sign a 'full' Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU). Although the EPA process has generated widespread critical commentary, few analysts have stopped to consider the motives of individual ACP countries and regions in their approach to the talks. In this article we consider the question of motives in relation to the CARIFORUM-EU EPA. Specifically, it asks why did CARIFORUM feel it necessary or desirable to sign a 'full' EPA, containing numerous provisions not actually mandated by the WTO, when the rest of the ACP was content to sign far less ambitious 'goods only' interim agreements? In order to address this question, the article goes beyond the extant EU-ACP trade literature to build on wider international political economy (IPE) scholarship, which has analysed the actions of developing countries in relation to a whole range of 'WTO-plus' North-South regional and bilateral FTAs. On this basis, the article stands back from the complex details of the agreement to analyse its wider significance, especially in terms of the presumed trade-off between the immediate economic benefits of improved and more secure market access, against the longer term costs of sacrificing the regulatory autonomy, or policy space, deemed necessary to pursue the type of trade and industrial policies deployed successfully in the past by both developed and (some) developing countries. Put simply, the article seeks to ascertain why ultimately CARIFORUM signed an agreement, what it gained from the negotiations and at what cost.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Industry; institution; institutionalization; legitimacy; politics; regulation";
ID;"CAPITALISM; VARIETIES; POLICY; JAPAN";
AB;Recent literature on the persistence or transformation of economic models frequently evokes the role of politics. However, such publications rarely set out precisely what politics is and how it plays out within specific sites of economic activity, particularly individual industries. In order to show that politics is the cause of both change within industries and difference between them, this article develops an institutionalist framework of analysis which seeks to elucidate the 'thickness' of the relationship between economic and political activities. Politics is first conceptualized in a way that opens up for research the emergence and evolution of the institutions which constrain and make industrial activity possible: behaviour that both discursively and interactively seeks to change or reproduce institutions by mobilizing values. Building upon existing institutionalist approaches in political economy and economic sociology, but also constructivist strands of political science, this definition is then used to set out a research design with which to conduct in-depth empirical study of the 'political work' undertaken within industries that lie behind perpetual processes of institutionalization. This work, and the intermediary concepts developed to study it - problematization and politicization - are illustrated throughout the piece by examples from two industries: automobile distribution and wine.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Transnational capital; Germany; European integration; interlocking directorates; corporate structures";
ID;"GOVERNANCE; CRISIS; UNION; COSTS";
AB;"European integration is interpreted in this paper as the route by which (West) Germany, profiting from close ties with the English-speaking West, was able to restore its full sovereignty and economic pre-eminence in Europe. Yet in shaping the actual integration process, it was France which played the key role. Most of the landmark steps towards the current EU were French proposals to pre-empt Anglophone-German collusion; creating European structures in which a resurgence of Germany (politically and economically) was made subject to permanent negotiation. German unification in 1991 removed the one reason why successive governments of the Federal Republic had gone along with this. Paradoxically, sovereign Germany today finds itself bound by the dense networks of consultation and decision-making which make the EU unique in the field of regional integration. The paper shows that between 1992 and 2005, German capital has moved to the centre of the network of corporate interlocks in the North Atlantic area. This helps to explain why in the post-1991, post-Soviet era of neoliberal, finance-driven globalisation, Germany is increasingly 'speaking for Europe', as its corporations have become nodal points in the communication structures through which the responses to the challenges facing the EU and the West at large are being shaped.";

ID;CONTEXT;
AB;Legitimacy is an important question to ask of the theory and practice of global governance. In this introduction, we make two propositions that are used to push thinking about these issues forward. Firstly, in analytical terms we outline a spectrum between legitimacy and legitimization which is aimed to capture the diverse set of approaches to this subject and to develop an engaged and reformist attitude that refuses the either-or distinction in favour of a methodologically pluralist logic of 'both and'. Secondly, in political terms, we argue that discussions of legitimate global governance in both policy and academic circles can carry a 'Trojan horse' quality whereby the ambiguity of the term might allow a point of intervention for more ambitious ethical objectives.;

AB;As each others' most important investment and trading partner, the European and U. S. American economies are closely interlinked. The growing intensity of economic interdependence has spurred the transatlantic coordination of rules and standards that could form non-tariff barriers to transatlantic commerce. But despite impressive government-to-government efforts to eliminate market barriers, the EU and the U. S. have frequently clashed over each other's regulatory policies. The aim of this special issue is to explore the domestic sources of cooperation or conflict in transatlantic regulation. The papers analyze the role of domestic factors through three theoretical lenses that are well-established in the study of multilevel systems: the principal-agent approach, the two-level game metaphor, and through a wider concept of institutionalism which emphasizes the interlinkages of societal interests and regulatory ideas with institutional frameworks. The papers reveal that domestic factors embody more obstacles to than opportunities for horizontal coordination. It is argued that transatlantic relations will likely undergo a 'double movement' of being simultaneously shifted upwards to become part of the global governance architecture, and downwards towards broader involvement of legislators in regulatory matters. Hence, transatlantic regulation might in the near future be more shaped by political leaders, rent-seeking interest groups and legislators than by networks of technocrats.;

AB;Do requirements for legitimate global governance vary across intergovernmental and non-state governance institutions? The author introduces a framework to address this question that draws attention to the social forces and power dynamics at play in determining what standards of legitimacy apply. Rather than beginning with a focus on democratic legitimacy, which pre-judges what legitimacy requires, the framework posits that what constitutes legitimacy results from an interaction of communities who must accept the authority of the institution with broader legitimating norms and discourses - or social structure - that prevail in the relevant issue area. To illustrate its plausibility, the framework is applied to a comparison of intergovernmental and non-state institutions in the social and environmental issue area: the intergovernmental Kyoto Protocol on climate change and members of the non-state International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance, an umbrella organization created to develop agreement on 'best practices' for its members. Implications of the findings for legitimacy of global economic governance are also explored.;

AB;What makes institutions that govern global finance legitimate? Contemporary debates, fuelled by the recent crisis, commonly draw on the concepts of input and output legitimacy to answer this question. As this article argues, however, this distinction is as difficult to apply in practice as it may be sensible in theory. Limitations in input legitimacy, which covers the inclusiveness and fairness of policy goal definition, cannot be compensated by higher output legitimacy, for example through supranational or global institutions. Whether such institutions are appropriate venues for producing policy hinges on the specific goals that they are charged to realize. And if these goals do not emerge from a deliberation process that can itself be considered legitimate, such institutions will do little to make policy outcomes more legitimate per se. After all, a supranational body might excel in the pursuit of one particular policy goal, but be wholly unsuitable to another. In short, this article argues that rather than seeking legitimacy of financial governance in the institutions through which it is made, we should focus on the desirability of specific policy outcomes and distribution of their costs and benefits when deciding how and by whom policy should be made. This argument is demonstrated using the case of capital market policy in the European Union, a case for which this article exposes serious legitimacy deficits, largely owing to an excessive influence of the financial industry compared to other societal stakeholders.;

TI;Whose legitimacy? Islamic finance and the global financial order;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Islamic finance; financial regulation; Sharia compliance; legitimacy; global finance";
ID;BANKING;
AB;Islamic finance is a fast growing segment of international financial markets. Deriving its core principles from the Quran and the Sharia, the objective of Islamic finance is to install a more equitable financial and economic order that at the same time is transaction-friendly. Thus, Islam could be seen as a foundation for the inclusion of the ethical and moral dimensions of economics and markets. This coincides with rising demand for Islamic financial products. Indeed, recent years have witnessed increasing efforts to develop and to institutionalise Islamic capital markets and above all, to make Islamic finance acceptable (and thus investable) to the mainstream. In this article, I use the question of legitimacy to explore whether Islamic finance offers an alternative to the existing international financial order. To this end, I take a closer look at the knowledge base from which Islamic financial products are constructed and assessed as well as the emerging international regulatory framework for Islamic financial markets. I conclude that efforts to expand the social constituency of Islamic finance to the transnational sphere of global finance are overly focused on its epistemic legitimation as normal financial activity. As a consequence, the currently emerging power, knowledge and governance structures for Islamic finance tend to emulate, and therefore largely reproduce, the existing global financial order.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Bond markets; financialization; government borrowing; Brazil; Lebanon; Turkey; financial crisis";
ID;LIQUIDITY;
AB;This article considers the varied borrowing capacity of emerging market governments, a key component of the impact on governments of financial globalization. It focuses on the link between the financialization - defined here as the ability to trade risk - and borrowing capacity, analyzing three case study countries: Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey. Both domestic and international bond markets are considered and differences in the ownership of government bonds in the three countries are highlighted. The financialization of different financial market actors is analyzed, concentrating on two of the most important, domestic commercial banks and individual investors, and the financialization of the structure of each market. It is argued that the greater the financialization, the greater the ability to exit or short. This increases the cost of borrowing and increases the likelihood, and severity, of crisis, thereby reducing government borrowing capacity. Comparative event studies from the three countries demonstrate the influence of financialization in crisis, or potential crisis, situations.;

ID;"CRISES; LIBERALIZATION; GLOBALIZATION; STRATEGIES; ECONOMICS; SYSTEM";
AB;The international community and many financial experts have singled out the positive elements of how strong institutional reforms following Mexico's 1995 and Turkey's 2001 banking crisis have shielded their banking sectors today from the wider economic impact of the world financial crisis. By contrast, this article argues from a historical materialist analytical approach that the 1995 and 2001 bank rescues and reforms preserved, renewed, and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of finance-led neoliberal capitalism in forms institutionally specific to Mexican and Turkish society. The post-crisis reforms reinforced the dominance of banking and finance capital in Mexico and Turkey at the expense of popular classes and society in general, and it is this dynamic of power that explains the resilience of banks today.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Double taxation; tax competition; rational institutional design; historical institutionalism; OECD; tax havens";
ID;"TAXATION; OECD; GLOBALIZATION; COORDINATION; COOPERATION; DEMOCRACIES; HARMFUL; REGIMES";
AB;This article presents a history of international tax governance and offers a rationalist reconstruction of its trajectory. As an unintended consequence of its institutional setup, the tax regime, which originally only dealt with double tax avoidance, produces harmful tax competition. Despite this negative effect there are only incremental and partial changes of the regime, which are insufficient to curb tax competition. I argue that this development can be explained by considering the properties - and the sequence in which they come up - of the collective action problems inherent in double tax avoidance and tax competition. First, in double tax avoidance, a coordination game with a distributive conflict, governments did not want to endanger the solution they had institutionalized long before tax competition became virulent. Second, governments are unable to resolve the emergent asymmetric prisoner's dilemma of tax competition due to conflicts of interest among big and small country governments and successful lobbying of corporate capital. As a result, the institutional trajectory is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of stability in the core principles and indirect and incremental changes of the rules in the form of rule stretching and layering.;

AB;"In policies for economic development, anti-corruption measures have received increased attention. The policy advice from the international ""good governance regime"", which is based on the principal-agent theory, is geared towards incremental change that will set in motion a ""virtues circle"". It is argued that this theory and the following incremental policy approach is dysfunctional for curbing corruption. It is unlikely that small institutional devices can set in motion a process towards establishing ""good governance"" in countries were corruption is systemic. Based on an understanding of corruption as an instance of the theory of collective action, it is argued that what is needed to establish a new equilibrium of social and economic exchange is a ""big-bang"" type of change. Incremental policies that are based on the principal-agent theory are likely to end in a ""social trap"" situation worsening the problem. The argument is illustrated by an historical case-study of how corruption was eradicated in 19th century Sweden.";

AB;This article investigates the emerging engagement of private actors and specifically Western corporations in international anti-corruption, drawing on Foucauldian studies of governmentality. It explores this engagement as governing practices that have emanated quite independently from the interstate system commonly understood to be at the core of the anti-corruption regime. It demonstrates how corporate anti-corruption ties in with a relatively new way of perceiving corruption. In this framing, anti-corruption comes out as risk management, which is latched on to notions of corporate social responsibility and business ethics. Moreover, the constitution of corruption risk relates to the rise of new actors and networks engaged in a wider business of anti-corruption, including commercial and hybrid actors that supply corporations with managerial instruments, benchmarks for best practice, rankings, and information and surveillance systems. This facilitates the enrollment of corporations into the anti-corruption cause while cultivating their competitiveness aspirations. The article offers a novel perspective on international anti-corruption and the position of business herein, and in a wider sense, it also contributes discussions about the role of private actors and their micro practices in global governance.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Competition policy; convergence; information; merger review; principal-agent; regulatory capture";
ID;"NATIONAL POLICY CONVERGENCE; EU COMPETITION POLICY";
AB;Despite high-profile divergences, competition officials in the European Union and United States frequently state a desire to reach convergent substantive decisions when regulating individual transatlantic merger cases. The extent of transatlantic convergence depends largely on the role of two domestic actors involved in the merger review process: regulators and firms. This article employs two competing approaches (principal-agent and regulatory capture) to assess the ways in which these actors and domestic institutions shape convergence in transatlantic merger review. Empirically, the article investigates the work of the EU-US Mergers Working Group and explores the extent to which it conforms more closely to the preferences of regulators or merging firms. By increasing procedural convergence over information exchanges, the competition regulators increase the likelihood of convergence in substantive decisions, which reduces the likelihood of intervention by political principals. The findings suggest that regulators have used their discretionary authority to overcome domestic political and legal institutions that obstruct information sharing and have reduced the information asymmetry traditionally enjoyed by merging firms. As a result, it is the regulatory agents who have shaped the convergent process via their discretionary authority and captured the merging firms to serve their regulatory interests.;

TI;Private interests and the EU-US dispute on audit regulation: The role of the European accounting profession;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
AB;Taking the European audit profession as a case study, our paper explores the role of private actors in transatlantic regulatory relations and transnational regulatory harmonization more generally. In the early twenty-first century, both the US and the EU tightened the regulation of auditors. Due to its extraterritorial effects, the US reform legislation sparked a transatlantic conflict. Seeking mutual recognition of the respective auditor oversight systems, the European Commission endeavored to bring the European regulatory regime closer to the new US model. During the reforms of EU audit regulation, the profession, together with member states, successfully resisted a far-reaching convergence of European regulation to the US model of independent oversight, thus impeding the resolution of the transatlantic conflict. We argue that the profession's defense of the traditional model of European audit regulation results from two intertwined aspects: the profession's interest in keeping a share of power in the regulatory regime and its institutional embeddedness in distinct national and regional regulatory and market structures. In concluding, we discuss the implications of our findings for the relevant international and comparative political economy literature.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Intellectual property; regulatory regimes; regulatory networks; transatlantic relations; patent regulation";
AB;Intellectual property assets and most notably patents are assumed as most crucial instruments for an effective commercial exploitation of technological inventions. Although both the US and Europe agree in principle that an enhanced cooperation between their patent offices would foster the economic development, various negotiation rounds to harmonize patent application standards have been frustrated during the last 30 years. In our article, we claim that neither the US nor the member states of the European Patent Organization are willing to invest their regulators with a comprehensive negotiation mandate. As long as the decision-making substantially remains within the competencies of domestic institutions, societal actors in both economic spheres prove able to impede any rapprochement. The article concludes with a few tentative generalizations about the relationship between transnational regulatory networks, their institutional embeddedness, and domestic actors' constellations.;

AB;Anti-terrorism cooperation has sparked a series of transatlantic conflicts. Many popular accounts look to differing policy preferences between US and European capitals to explain these disagreements. This article, by contrast, contends that these disputes are often rooted in internal multi-level governance processes within Europe that present different opportunity structures for actors to influence international debates. The case of airline passenger name records offers a unique within-case comparison akin to a natural experiment with which to examine the multi-level governance hypothesis.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
ID;"UNILATERAL TRADE-POLICY; UNITED-STATES; SETTLEMENT; RESOLUTION; EUROPE";
AB;"When the transatlantic trade dispute over genetically modified organisms came to a boil in the late 1990s and early 2000s it was widely expected to be highly conflictual. The United States was, almost universally, expected to challenge fundamentally the European Union's regulatory system for GMOs before the World Trade Organisation, and was equally universally expected to win the case. The EU was widely, albeit not universally, expected to refuse to comply with the ruling. In keeping with most of the international political economy literature on trade disputes, both of these expectations were rooted in assessments of societal demands for action and resistance. Both expectations, however, were confounded; the US (and its co-complainants) filed a narrow challenge focusing on the EU's failure to apply its own procedures; and the EU, somewhat falteringly, has resumed approvals of GMOs. Applying a two-level game framework, this article argues that this relatively cooperative outcome is explained by the executives of both polities exercising their autonomy to pursue policies closer to the preferences of the other polity than their median domestic constituents would have preferred. This article, therefore, makes the case for taking government preferences and autonomy seriously when analysing the outcomes of trade disputes. Moreover, it emphasises that compliance with international rules engages with on-going internal policy processes and debates.";

To provide a broad foundation for further thinking on this organization, we analyse its evolution over half a century from two perspectives: phases in the international political economy and the literature on IPE. By so doing, we uncover two paradoxes. Firstly, we find that the organization's evolution closely mirrored major phases in the postwar international political economy until recently. However, the OECD's long-term dependence on the West has now become an obstacle to its efforts to adapt to the latest phase, characterised by the rise of non-Western powers. Secondly, we show that, during the OECD's ""golden age"", scholars paid relatively little attention to the organization but, from the 2000s, as the organization faced an unprecedented challenge of its potential economic decline, IPE literature on the organization blossomed.";

DT;Article;
DE;"OECD; Jobs Strategy; flexicurity; inclusive liberalism";
ID;"LABOR-MARKET; WELFARE; POWER";
AB;This paper focuses on the OECD's Strategy, which became a principal means for the OECD to promote a neo-liberal model of social and employment policy to its member states and it also influenced the European Union's employment strategy. Yet important modifications were introduced in 2006 with the recognition of an alternative policy path, 'flexicurity.' While the latter accepted neoliberal macroeconomic 'fundamentals,' it broke with neoliberalism to the extent that it recognized a positive role for labour market regulations and social policies in promoting security and social inclusion. The paper analyses the politics associated with this shift, using the concept of 'organisational discourse' to get at the dynamic (and contested) nature of the OECD's ideational lens. While the OECD came under pressure from some of its member states to alter its 'one size fits all' strategy, the Economics Department, whose version of the discourse initially dominated, was also challenged from within by the Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs (DELSA), which developed its own alternative discourse.;

AB;Civil servants in international secretariats are exposed to numerous, crosscutting and, at times, conflicting pressures and expectations. The secretariat of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is no different. This study reveals a fundamental 'misfit' between external demands and internal dynamics in the OECD Secretariat. On one hand, the OECD analysts are employed on the basis of merit. Compared to the employees in the central administrations in many OECD member states, the OECD personnel are very competitive in terms of experience and academic skills. Thus, the OECD Secretariat can be seen as a veritable powerhouse of idea generation, data collection and analysis. On the other hand, the OECD member states seem to be reluctant to let the OECD do what it does best: produce bright, challenging and provocative ideas. In many regards, the OECD personnel are, in practice, being reduced to undertaking basic secretariat functions such as organizing meetings, writing summaries and arbitrating between conflicting national interests. Despite having a vast role repertoire of roles at their disposal, this article reveals the paradox when OECD officials play out only two roles: the epistemic role, in which creative thinking and innovation are rewarded, and the bureaucratic role, in which rule following and regularity are rewarded. This paradox is characterized as a role dilemma that is compatible with the idea of the OECD as an international compound bureaucracy. The article concludes by suggesting three scenarios of how the observed dissonance between the internal and external dimensions of the OECD identity can be accommodated.;

AB;A survey of the literature on the political economy of global financial liberalization shows how little has been written on the role of the OECD, and how the Principal-Agent (PA) theory, complemented by Constructivist tools, can be applied helpfully to analyse this process. We show that the OECD's Committee on Capital Movements and Invisible Transactions (CMIT) played an entrepreneurial role in encouraging the liberalization of capital flows. In particular, we argue that the CMIT slipped by acting beyond its core delegation roles and against the preferences of the OECD member states' governments. This was done by discussing and seeking to expand the list of issue areas on which controls should be lifted to include short-term capital movements and the right of establishment, to adopt an extended understanding of reciprocity, and to eliminate a range of additional discriminatory measures on capital flows. Acting as institutional entrepreneurs, the CMIT members took advantage of the overlap among the networks in which they were engaged to spread their ideas to the member states. The CMIT's work affected the member states' willingness to make irrevocable, multilateral commitments through a combination of peer pressure and vertical institutional interconnectedness. Through the work of the CMIT, the OECD was an important actor in capital liberalization, in addition to the role played by other international organizations.;

AB;"During the eighties, industrialized countries increasingly used tied aid to circumvent international agreements restricting export subsidies for capital goods. The 1991 Helsinki Disciplines restricted the use of tied aid as a tool of export promotion. In export subsidy competition, donor states have a collective interest in avoiding spiraling escalation of spending; but, reaching international agreements is difficult when preferences over levels of expenditure vary between them. States that favor greater restraint on export subsidies can make subsidy competition prohibitively expensive by increasing their expenditures. However, this requires them to threaten substantial increases in spending when they have a demonstrated preference against doing so. Successful cooperation can only occur when governments with sufficient budgetary resources prefer subsidy reduction, but can mobilize domestic constituencies to make subsidy retaliation credible. Despite an apparent decline in international influence, the U. S. was able to compel accession to the Helsinki agreement by threatening substantial increases in its spending. This article uses a process-tracing approach to demonstrate the role of domestic politics in making that threat credible.";

DE;"Latin America; oil; gas; hydrocarbons; nationalization; populism; petroleum";
ID;"POPULISM; LDCS";
AB;Recent hydrocarbon nationalizations in Bolivia, Venezuela, and Ecuador have renewed debates about the dangers of radicals, populists, or leftists. But, while some of these presidents have acted aggressively towards multinational owners, as a group their policies have not differed greatly from non-leftists facing similar circumstances. To test our hypothesis, we provide a detailed three-variable coding of every Mexican and South American president (for all countries with oil resources), as well as a coding of their policies towards the hydrocarbons industry. The historical review shows that political leaders from all sides of the ideological spectrum have advocated, pursued, or sustained nationalizations, and thus there is no clear relation between these political labels and nationalization policies. An examination of two alternative hypotheses - timing and starting point - finds that while nationalizations and privatizations do come in bunches, the hydrocarbon policy and economic circumstances that presidents inherit are more likely to determine the policy that they pursue.;

ID;"TAX HAVENS; CONSTRUCTION; CORPORATE; ISLANDS; PLACE; TRUST; MONEY; POWER";
AB;Offshore finance provides an incubator and testing ground for propositions concerning fundamental debates in international political economy. The common feature among offshore financial products is calculated ambiguity: the ability to give diametrically opposed but legally valid answers to the same question from different quarters. Thus offshore allows individuals and firms to enjoy simultaneous ownership and non-ownership, to be high profit and loss-making, heavily indebted but also debt-free, and for investment to be foreign and domestic. The advantages conferred to individuals and firms, however, tend to undermine the stability of the financial system. Using indirect governance techniques, transnational networks of regulators have sought to coercively simplify offshore finance, with mixed results. Focusing on ambiguity as central to offshore finance complements earlier theoretical treatments of this realm from law, anthropology and international relations. Empirically, the recently enhanced surveillance of offshore centers has produced new data facilitating future quantitative studies, which complement more anthropological approaches to this subject.;

TI;Revisiting 50 years of market-making: The neoliberal transformation of European competition policy;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Capitalism; competition; competition policy; regulatory discourses; embedded liberalism; neoliberalism";
ID;CAPITALISM;
AB;The article analyses the evolution of European competition policy. It is argued that the content, form, and scope of competition regulation has undergone a major transformation over the past fifty years, which is related to broader socio-economic developments. Until the mid-1980s, competition policy formed part of the institutional nexus of the postwar order of 'embedded liberalism', underpinned by a Fordist accumulation regime and Keynesian welfare institutions. It exemplified strong neo-mercantilist and protectionist traits, allowing for significant distortions of competition, whenever justified for general reasons of industrial and social policy. Since the mid-1980s, gradually, a neoliberal 'competition only' vision came to dominate, giving rise to a more market-based competition regime, in which private rather than public actors prevail, and which seeks to create an ever-bigger 'level playing field' of free markets. This transformation is linked to the broader context of the disruption of the postwar social order and the rise of neoliberalism. A public-private alliance of transnational actors, consisting of the European Commission's DG Competition and transnational business elite networks, were the driving forces behind the 'neoliberalisation' of competition policy.;

TI;The promise and perils of private voluntary regulation: Labor standards and work organization in two Mexican garment factories;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Private voluntary regulation; labor standards; globalization";
ID;"PERFORMANCE; RIGHTS; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS";
AB;What role can corporate codes of conduct play in monitoring compliance with international labor standards and improving working conditions in global supply chains? How does this system of private voluntary regulation relate to other strategies and regulatory approaches aimed at promoting just working conditions in global supply chains? This paper explores the potential and limitations of private voluntary regulation through a detailed matched pair case study of two factories supplying Nike, the world's largest athletic footwear and apparel company. These two factories have many similarities - both are in Mexico, both are in the apparel industry, both produce more or less the same products for Nike (and other brands) and both are subject to the same code of conduct. On the surface, both factories appear to have similar employment (i.e. recruitment, training, remuneration) practices and they receive comparable scores when audited by Nike's compliance staff. However, underlying (and somewhat obscured by) these apparent similarities, significant differences in actual labor conditions exist between these two factories. What drives these differences in working conditions? What does this imply for traditional systems of monitoring and codes of conduct? Field research conducted at these two factories reveals that beyond the code of conduct and various monitoring efforts aimed at enforcing it, workplace conditions and labor standards are shaped by very different patterns of work organization and human resource management policies. The promotion of these alternative work/human resources management practices can complement traditional monitoring efforts in ways that promoted improved labor standards.;

DE;"Global commodity chains; regulation; ATPA; incorporated comparison; non-traditional exports; cut flowers; development";
ID;"LOCAL GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; INDUSTRY; TRADE; PERSPECTIVE; FORDISM; WOMEN; POWER";
AB;Export-oriented development strategies and trade regimes encourage the incorporation of developing country exports into northern markets, often bringing them into competition with domestic suppliers. While studies of transnational commodity flows focus on the organization and coordination of economic activities over geographic space, little research has been done on their competitive relations. In this article, I focus on the political economy of disputes over market access by linking trade regimes to the economic and political activities of actors in the rival Colombian and US cut flower commodity chains. I argue that the regulation of the Colombian and US cut flower commodity chains is a process marked by institutional mediation and political and economic contestation. In shaping their economic spaces, a combination of shifting discourses, litigation, and political lobbying in sites of power are used by economic actors to meet their interests. The examination of rivalry over market access shows variation in the configuration of economic activity in the US cut flower market over time while drawing attention to the dynamic interaction among economic actors, institutions, and markets.;

DE;"Fair trade; normative IPE; globalization; IPE theory; underdevelopment; North; South relations";
ID;"COMMODITY FETISHISM; COFFEE; MARKET; REGIMES";
AB;Since the mid-1990s fair trade has gained consumers and public attention, but international political economy (IPE) scholars have had little to say about this new phenomenon. Since the fair trade concept is based on consumer behavior that incorporates moral and ethical choices, it cannot easily be explained by mainstream IPE theories which are predominantly based on the rational actor model. This paper examines the fair trade movement, discusses its history, its impressive growth and the ethical and social agenda it promotes. Fair trade is an anomaly that cannot be explained by mainstream rationalist ontologies. Instead, the authors argue, IPE theories need to consider classical political economy works which reveal many valuable insights regarding moral and/or ethical concerns. By reintroducing normative considerations fair trade can reconnect consumer and producer, move our theories beyond merely rationalist ontologies and humanize globalization.;

TI;Why some countries thrive despite corruption: The role of trust in the corruption-efficiency relationship;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Corruption; trust; social network; relation-based; economic growth";
ID;"GROWTH; MODEL; GOVERNANCE; GUANXI; RULE";
AB;While it is widely accepted that corruption negatively affects economic growth, why some countries achieve rapid growth under rampant corruption remains a puzzle. This article sheds light on this issue by examining the role of trust in the corruption-efficiency relationship. It argues that in countries with a relatively low level of trust, corruption tends to be more predatory and inefficient than corruption in countries with a relatively high level of trust, which tends to be less predatory (or relatively more 'efficiency-enhancing'). To illustrate their arguments, the authors first conduct a qualitative comparative case study of China and the Philippines. They then further subject their ideas to a quantitative test using a pooled data set of 65 countries in two time periods. Both their case study and statistical test support their general hypothesis that trust mitigates the negative effect of corruption on economic growth.;

ID;"FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS; JAPAN; BILATERALISM; CHINA; LIBERALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; PACIFIC; MOVE; FTA";
AB;The proliferation of regional economic agreements involving East Asian economies in the years since the financial crises is usually explained in the political economy literature by reference to economic factors. These agreements have been viewed either as a response to the costs of increasing interdependence and/or to the demand by domestic exporters to level the playing field when their rivals benefit from preferential trade agreements. A detailed examination of economic data finds no support, however, for the argument that intra-regional economic interdependence in East Asia has increased significantly since the financial crises. Case studies suggest that business has not played a major role in either promoting or opposing the agreements - not surprisingly in that the agreements are unlikely to have a major economic impact, and are not being widely used. Rather than there being an 'economic domino' effect at work, the new East Asian regionalism is best understood as being driven by a 'political domino' effect.;

ID;"FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS; PRIME-MINISTER; POLICY";
AB;"The last decade has witnessed Japan's transformation from one of the last hard core multilateralists to an active negotiator of free trade agreements (FTAs). This striking policy shift raises the question as to whether FTAs can finally deliver substantial liberalization of the Japanese market, a goal long sought by Japan's trading partners and domestic champions of structural reform. I argue that Japan's ability to negotiate such high-yield FTAs (with large trading partners, and encompassing substantial market access concessions and multiple WTO plus commitments) will hinge upon the intensity of lobbying by the internationalized business sector to overcome the resistance of uncompetitive sectors; and the centralization of domestic policy-making in order to break the protectionist inertia of traditional subgovernments. In developing this argument, I modify existing demand/supply models of FTA policy to factor in the preferences of societal actors in the game of selective and discriminatory liberalization and to take into account the influence of domestic political institutions through the logic of principal-agent relations.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"China; policy making; FTA; regionalism; economic diplomacy";
ID;"POLITICS; REGIONALISM";
AB;China is widely viewed as exceptional in its free trade agreement (FTA) activity for two reasons. First, the existing literature on East Asian regionalism has treated China as a strategic unitary actor. Second, Chinese policy elites claim that China is exceptional for its 'big country morality' of seeking to provide agreements that benefit smaller countries. What drives China's trade policy in the 'post-WTO' era? More precisely, does China, as a state ruled by a Communist Party, have different factors affecting its FTA policy-making than do other states? Is China pursuing FTAs 'with Chinese characteristics': are the motivations behind China's FTAs different from those of other countries? The research presented in this paper finds that China's FTA policymaking process involves a lot of bargaining and is particularly affected by the relative weakening of liberalizing forces vis-a-vis protectionist ones after the WTO accession. Moreover, the effectiveness of economic diplomacy is affected by coordination problems between economic and political sections within the government. Although China has a few motivations that go beyond what drives other countries to FTAs, those expectations are either difficult to realize or not very useful even if realized.;

AB;The member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been frequently criticized for adhering to a long-standing norm of strict non-interference in each other's domestic affairs, thereby hampering collective efforts to address regional problems. This article presents an analytical model of international institutions that shows how underlying norms and principles - the meta-regime - govern the rules and procedures of specific international regimes. It then applies this model to ASEAN's trade and anti-haze regimes, demonstrating how ASEAN's underlying meta-regime has frustrated attempts to liberalize trade and reduce air pollution. While ASEAN's purview has extended well beyond its original security mandate and it has developed new rules and procedures to handle the new issues, its underlying norms and principles consistently limit its ability to handle regional problems. In the conclusion, we discuss how the ASEAN states might be able to foment cooperation in these issue areas without completely abandoning its foundational norms and principles.;

AB;This article examines the influence of 'track two' policy networks in shaping regional political and security cooperation in East Asia. It focuses on two of the most established and lauded political-security networks: the ASEAN-Institutes of Strategic and International Studies (ASEAN-ISIS) and the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP), critically exploring their effectiveness and influence today. Drawing on extensive interviews, participant observation and an analysis of documentary sources, it concludes that there is little evidence to suggest these networks have affected the significant institutional change described in much of the literature. Rather, there is persuasive evidence that their influence on track one has waned in recent years. After canvassing a range of alternative explanations for this state of affairs, it argues that recent scholarship on track two has paid insufficient attention to the scope conditions that are a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for unofficial networks to successfully achieve policy diffusion. Non-official diplomacy can affect institutional change, but it is less common than most accounts suggest.;

DT;Article;
DE;"NAFTA; trade; economists; competitiveness; mercantilism; neoliberalism";
ID;"ECONOMIC IDEAS; MEXICO; AGREEMENTS; MARKET; NAFTA; POLITICS; ORIGINS";
AB;Research on trade policymaking often fails to recognize important disagreements between economists, on the one hand, and economic and political elites, on the other. As a consequence, many studies overstate the prevalence of economists' neoclassical trade theory among businesspeople and politicians, and its intellectual influence on the practice of trade negotiations and policymaking. While economists, politicians, and businesspeople often do support the same (neoliberal) agreements and policies, the worldviews motivating and embodied in their endorsements are consistently different. Economists' formalized neoclassical theory fully endorses international market liberalism, primarily on the basis of expected benefits for consumers, and substantially de-emphasizes conflicts of interest across nations. Businesspeople's and politicians' more informal and practical support for 'free trade' agreements primarily values them for their benefits to producers, and frequently evokes visions of win-lose competition among nations. Empirically, I defend these arguments using qualitative data from a comparative-historical study of the formation of the 1989 Canada-US Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.;

ID;"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; GOVERNANCE; BITS; INSTITUTIONS; COMMITMENT; AGREEMENTS; INFLOWS; COSTS; MODEL; LAW";
AB;The proliferation of North-South bilateral investment treaties (BITs), which provide investors with favorable treatment and legal protections, is one of the most remarkable trends of the contemporary global economy. Presumably, developing countries conclude these agreements in order to attract much-needed capital to their economies. Although the positive effect of BITs on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows may seem straightforward, the findings produced by extant research are mixed. This article advances the study of the relationship between BITs and FDI in two manners. First, it draws attention to the often underappreciated distinction between signed and mutually-ratified treaties. It argues that only BITs in force function as a costly signal of pro-investment climate and a credible commitment to the protection of FDI. Second, it employs a comprehensive data set on American investment in developing countries to empirically evaluate the effect of BITs on FDI inflows. Employing a variety of model specifications and accounting for potential endogeneity, the findings indicate that BITs have the expected positive effect on FDI inflows, but only to the extent that they are in force.;

AB;"This article locates the political determinants of stock market development in the distributional cleavages among voters and interest groups. Our argument questions the prevailing explanation about the role of partisanship in the literature, where it is usually assumed that left governments frighten investors. To the extent that financial development is translated into higher levels of investment that increases labor demand, workers and the parties representing them will adopt policies and regulations that favor the capitalization of financial markets. We explore the empirical content of our hypothesis against several competing explanations: the legal origins school, which argues common law proxies stronger investor protections than civil law; the electoral law school, which argues proportional representation provides weaker protections than do majoritarian ones; the institutional economics view, which argues that checks on policy-making discretion such as veto gates protect the property rights of investors and encourage investment. We test the implications of the different arguments on the level of stock market capitalization in a panel of 85 countries over the period 1975-2004. We find preliminary evidence in favor of the partisanship hypothesis: left-leaning governments are more likely to be associated with higher stock market capitalization than their counterparts to the right and center of the political spectrum. These results are consistent with recent theories emphasizing an emerging coalition of workers and owners against managers in favor of greater transparency and shareholder protection.";

AB;The study of international security and political economy are two sides of the same coin. Yet the disciplinary fields of security studies and political economy too often maintain a deliberate distance from each other. The three books discussed in this article are a welcome departure from such an artificial division between (inter)national security issues on the one hand, and economic issues on the other. Furthermore, like much political economy scholarship, they each aim to incorporate an analytical focus on domestic politics that many international security scholars still eschew. Such a broader (re-)integration of the domestic political economy dimension of security into international relations scholarship provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical understanding of how and why national security, like all areas of public policy, is riddled with the pursuit of political agendas.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Ethics; IPE; power; pragmatism; resistance";
ID;"IPE; MARKET";
AB;The article provides a critical analysis of how IPE might engage with the question of ethics. After reviewing existing calls to bring ethics and ethical considerations within the mainstream of the discipline several questions are made. Drawing from critical and post-structural thought, it is argued that existing accounts of ethics privilege a problematic separation between ethics and power. Power is depicted as obligation - as power over -while ethics is depicted as an ameliorative other to power. We draw out several limits in this separation - including the reification of market subjectivities of contract, individualism, and a problematic global scale - arguing that ethics should be seen as a constitutive discourse like any other. Power is re-phrased as productive, as the power to. We conclude by articulating a pragmatist research agenda that seeks to foster the kernel 'possibility' in discourses of ethics while retaining sensitivity to the potential constitutive 'violence' of ethics. Given this dilemma, we argue that ongoing practices of 'resistance' - in both practical and scholarly senses - should be a central problematic for engaging with the (political) question of ethics in IPE.;

ID;"FLEXIBLE SPECIALIZATION; FILM INDUSTRY; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE";
AB;Since the late 1980s, academic literature has polarised over how to represent organisational change and financial resolution within Hollywood. For some, Hollywood is an example of flexible production with win-win outcomes for all. For others, the major studios have entrenched their global power at the expense of others. This paper presents a different take on Hollywood which builds on the observations of stock market analysts about the absence of adequate corporate profits, set in the context of financialisation and its discontents. In Hollywood, the 'search for synergy' motivates a strategy of perpetual restructuring, where results will usually disappoint. The lack of profit is explained as due to the uncontrollable pay demands of key 'creatives', the mature market for film, and the mismatch between price and cost in the industry. The implication of this different take is that the absence of corporate profit is chronic and inherent in the business model, so that Hollywood is both a graveyard for corporate business which searches for but does not find profits, and a field of opportunity for a small number of strategically positioned individuals - stars and directors - who become seriously rich.;

AB;The paper provides an explanation for a puzzling aspect of China's nascent sovereign wealth system, namely the ever-more obvious competition between China's officially designated sovereign wealth fund (SWF), the China Investment Corporation (CIC), and the foreign exchange reserve management agency, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). We outline an analytical framework which illuminates the various pathways by which state leaders seek to address a principal-agent problem common to all sovereign wealth funds. We suggest that state leaders select corporate governance regimes that mesh with what we call the state's 'governance endowments'. We then substantiate the claim that China's particular governance endowments have led China's leaders to embrace a corporate governance model premised on competition among the state's sovereign wealth investors. We trace the intense bureaucratic conflicts that shaped the creation of CIC and then show how SAFE was subsequently drawn into competition with CIC in the area of high risk, high yield investment. Although China's SWF tournament emerged as a quite unintended consequence of bureaucratic politics, China's leadership has since tacitly endorsed this rivalry because it has supplied the government with valuable carrot and stick mechanisms with which to discipline fund managers.;

DE;"Conformity assessment; standards; accreditation; governance; globalization";
ID;"VALUE CHAINS; GOVERNANCE; CERTIFICATION; QUALITY; SECTOR";
AB;This paper explores the construction of what the authors term a 'tripartite standards regime' (TSR) by looking at the pragmatic emergence of standards development organizations (SDOs) and national accreditation bodies (NABs). The authors explain how, through their network of audit, the TSR is entangling intermediaries and processes into specific supply chains. Moreover, they argue that the emphasis placed on the role of 'metrology' is overstated in the literature. Rather, the concept of 'standards' better captures the more complex, underlying processes involved in the construction of the TSR. They present evidence gathered through a review of data collected from SDOs' and NABs' websites, official documents, international trade agreements, and the directories published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the International Organization for Standardization. They argue that the TSR acts as a techno-economic network that is global in reach and serves a key coordinating role in facilitating international trade. As such they see the TSR as fundamental to the movement towards 'governing at a distance' that is part and parcel of the neoliberal shift from government to governance.;

ID;"PROPER ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATION; GRAVITY EQUATION; AID; GROWTH; MODELS; REGRESSIONS; POLICIES";
AB;Pundits and scholars have long debated the effectiveness of foreign aid: does it lead to economic growth or is it simply throwing money 'down the rat hole'? This paper re-invigorates the debate by examining the question through a new lens. Rather than examining the effectiveness of general foreign aid on economic growth, this paper tests the impact of targeted foreign aid on a narrower economic activity. Specifically, this paper investigates the impact of United States trade capacity building aid. This targeted aid aims to increase recipient countries' exporting capacity, which may lead to growth, rather than directly increasing growth. If trade capacity building assistance is universally effective, one would expect to see increases in recipient-country exports to both the US and the rest of the world. If trade capacity building is selectively effective, recipient-country exports should increase only to the US. If trade capacity building is ineffective, one would expect no impact on recipient-country exports. This paper finds substantial support that US trade capacity building is selectively effective. US trade capacity building tends to increase recipient-country exports to the United States, but not to the rest of the world. Although the US results may not be generalizable to other donors, this approach suggests an easily expandable research program.;

TI;US antidumping actions against China: the impact of China's entry into the World Trade Organization;

DT;Article;
DE;"China; United States; antidumping; World Trade Organization (WTO); trade protectionism";
ID;"UNITED-STATES; WTO; PROTECTIONISM";
AB;This paper engages in a preliminary examination of US antidumping actions against China and addresses the conditions under which US industries are likely to initiate antidumping petitions against Chinese firms and obtain affirmative antidumping rulings from regulatory authorities. We conjecture that China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) has not enhanced the prospect of Chinese firms successfully defending themselves against antidumping suits initiated by the US for three reasons. First, the rather dramatic expansion in US-China trade and, in particular, in US imports from China, has led US antidumping authorities to more aggressively pursue antidumping cases against China. Second, WTO membership has resulted in increasing US investment in China, thus undercutting the competitive advantage of some small domestic firms relative to those that have invested in the Chinese market, and leading the former to lobby more rigorously for protection from Chinese imports. Third, as China has agreed to the non-market economy (NME) designation in antidumping investigations for up to 15 years upon accession, its NME status has led US antidumping authorities to apply more stringent criteria in antidumping investigations. We support our argument with statistical analyses of the pattern of US antidumping initiation and adjudication against China.;

AB;As dramatically evidenced by the global financial crisis, the interaction of domestic regulatory systems has significant international consequences. Nevertheless, these relationships have received only limited attention from international relations scholars. This special issue, therefore, provides a detailed examination of international market regulation - the processes through which the domestic regulatory activities of states and other actors set the effective rules of internationally-exposed markets. To this end, we borrow and extend on arguments developed by historical institutionalists in comparative politics and American political development. In particular, the contributions adapt two mechanisms - policy feedbacks and relative sequencing - to explain state and bureaucratic preferences over international market regulation as well as bargaining strength in relevant negotiations. In addition to contributing to central IPE debates about international economic governance, the individual contributions shed light on a number of important empirical domains such as corporate accounting, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, hedge funds, and financial market standardization.;

AB;The gravitational pull of US capital markets in the early 1990s created incentives for foreign multinational companies and governments to adopt orconverge to American accounting standards, US Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (US GAAP). Fifteen years later, more than a hundred countries had accepted (or planned to accept) a single set of accounting standards - yet not the American ones. Instead, a London-based private body had become the world's standard setter, and even in the US there was serious discussion about phasing out national standards for multinational companies. My explanation for change in the international politics of accounting standards emphasizes two conceptual tools featured in this special issue: cross-border sequencing effects and internal institutional configurations and capacity building. Unlike previous work that centers on the rise of private or technical authority or gives pride of place to either EU regional reform and capacity building or US developments, this article attributes the change in the politics of accounting standards to a sequence of developments that took place in the transatlantic political arena, inside and between these two large polities. The order and timing by which the US created and the EU emulated institutional configurations and regulatory capacities determined the particular set of transatlantic interactions. If the US or the EU had never developed these arrangements and capacities or had developed them in a different sequence or at different historical moments, transatlantic interactions would likely have followed an alternate path and generated different types of international politics.;

DE;"Sequencing; transgovernmental politics; regulatory capacity; historical institutionalism; pharmaceuticals; cosmetics";
ID;"HARMONIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; POLITICS; POLICY; GLOBALIZATION; COOPERATION; DEPENDENCE; STANDARDS; MARKETS; BRITAIN";
AB;Over the last three decades, the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries have become increasingly global. To ensure product safety and consumer protection, regulators in leading markets have applied domestic rules extraterritorially and have joined forces to harmonize rules through transgovernmental cooperation. Yet whereas the United States has long been the dominant player in international market regulation of pharmaceuticals, the European Union has decisively shaped global rules for cosmetics. What explains differences in agenda setting power across the two closely-related industries? We compare and contrast the expectations of a realist account focused on market size and a liberal functionalist argument centered on the role of market friction with a historical institutionalist explanation stressing the relative sequential development over time of domestic regulatory capacity in leading markets. The empirical evidence shows that domestic regulatory institutions systematically shape international market regulation. Historical institutionalism provides an important complement to existing transgovernmental research, offering clear expectations for the origins of and terms of influence within such cooperation. More generally, it opens up a rich toolbox for the analysis of industry-level global market governance, which affects the daily lives of many millions of consumers.;

DE;"G20; hedge funds; historical institutionalism; international market regulation; state preferences; varieties of capitalism";
ID;"HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; POLITICS";
AB;After years of acrimonious debate among leading industrialized states, the G20 reached an agreement in 2009 on the regulation of hedge funds. Anchored in an institutional theory of government action that draws on historical institutionalism, this article finds that cleavages between liberal market economies (US, Britain) and organized market economies (Germany, France) determined the failure to regulate hedge funds in the 1990s, the origins of a self-governance regime in the mid-2000s, as well as the nature of the G20 agreement in 2009. Historical institutionalism offers an important complement to theoretical traditions in international political economy (IPE) that stress the role of states' market power in shaping international regulatory regimes, especially in accounting for how the evolution of state preferences affect the nature of international regulation over time. The article concludes with suggestions for how historical institutionalism can be extended beyond its typical purview in comparative politics to give analytical and substantive nuance to the study of international market regulation.;

AB;This article explores the effort, during the last decade, to develop a set of global standards and codes to govern international capital markets. I posit that, despite global capital market pressures, this effort should have limited success in low and middle-income countries. Drawing upon a historical institutionalist framework, I suggest that domestic political institutions, as well as interests, often will lead to the failure of governments to implement global codes and standards. After describing briefly the motivations for and substance of the standards and code project, I summarize trends in the national implementation of such standards. I then point to several instances of policy feedback, in which the existing domestic regulatory institutions in middle-income countries rendered the adoption of new international rules difficult, technically as well as politically.;

DE;"Intellectual property; trade; historical institutionalism; developing countries";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; POLICY DIFFUSION; POWER; STATES";
AB;One of the most dramatic instances of international market regulation in the twentieth century was the adoption of a multilateral, enforceable, intellectual property protection regime at the end of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) ushered in a new era of high standards of intellectual property protection, requiring profound and costly domestic institutional changes in many, many countries. International market regulation has increasingly penetrated domestic regulatory environments in ways that have compromised domestic political bargains. Historical institutionalism can help to explain the emergence of a global regime for intellectual property protection as a product of institutional change in the US. Historical institutionalism provides a lens to examine the directly political (rather than technocratic or efficiency maximizing) processes establishing domestic and international power relations.;

While the work showcased herein is by scholars from Europe and North America (reflecting a western bias), the diversity in the empirical cases goes some way to overcoming the focus on North American countries. The contributions vary from transnational accounts of social reproduction to the study of changes in social reproduction in the countries of the global south. The collection also offers contrasts in research on the macroeconomic level with research on the microeconomic level in order to allow for an understanding of people's experiences of changes in patterns of social reproduction.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Social reproduction; inclusive neoliberalism; poverty reduction; World Bank; Nicaragua";
AB;This article invokes Gramscian theory in an effort to better grasp the reorganization of social reproduction under neoliberal globalization. It argues that recent transformations in the world development order warrant a rethinking of the concept of social reproduction, towards acknowledging the increasingly apparent role of transnational governance institutions in organizing social reproduction processes, particularly in peripheral countries. To substantiate this argument, the article interrogates the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper development approach, the most visible policy tool of the post-Washington Consensus. In the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process, the World Bank has started to link debt relief administered through the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC II) initiative to the delivery of basic social services to the poor, and directly finances human capital investments through conditional cash transfer programs. While conditionalities attached to Bank funding continue to promote the privatization of various state functions associated with social reproduction, especially in the areas of health care and education, the Bank, at the same time, funds 'social inclusion' programs that directly absorb some of these functions. This signals the emergence of a new social reproduction regime of 'conditional inclusion' under World Bank leadership.;

AB;In recent years, the production of a gendered and racialised underclass of non-citizen domestic workers has come to play an increasingly important role in meeting the socially reproductive needs of middle class Malaysian households. This article considers the extent to which rights based approaches to migrant worker rights endorsed by both International Organisations and regional and local (Malaysian) nongovernmental organisations are sufficient in tackling the problems and issues faced by female migrants employed as domestic workers. The first part of the article critically engages with the dominant 'rights based approach to migration' endorsed, in particular, by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) suggesting that this approach fails to make a substantive commitment to gender justice, not least, because of the way in which domestic work remains a largely invisible and frequently unrecognised form of employment. The second part of the article draws upon data collected from key activist organizations engaged in struggles on behalf of migrant domestic workers in Malaysia. This discussion is situated within the broader context of debates over the role of economic rights within feminist understandings and critiques of human rights and 'rights based approaches'. Noting the dominance of the issue of violence against women (VAW) within feminist human rights discourse, I argue that whilst the VAW framework is a useful tool for understanding how and why women migrants may be vulnerable to abuse, it is perhaps not enough and there is a need to think more critically about how questions of women's economic status and 'rights' feature in discussions of the gendered and racialised nature of (care) work in the global economy.;

DE;"Social reproduction; tourism; gender; Central America; development";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; GENDER; CHILDREN; SOUTH";
AB;This research speaks to two themes on which little empirical work has been carried out in IPE: tourism and social reproduction. It focuses on changing relations of social reproduction in two tourism communities in Central America - Placencia in Belize and Monteverde and Costa Rica. In contrast to the majority of literature on social reproduction, the starting point for this analysis is not the reprivatisation of social reproduction but rather an exploration of how actors in tourism communities in Central America negotiate the tensions between capitalist development and social reproduction in a context of minimal state provision. Drawing on extensive field research in these communities, I identify a gap in social reproduction generated by women's intensive and anti-social working conditions in the tourism industry combined with enduring attitudes that social reproduction remains the responsibility of women. The paper explores the responses to this gap, setting out two clear trends - the 'contracting out' of social reproduction and the construction of policies which aim to minimise the impact of tourism development on social reproduction. I argue that both of these responses represent privatised solutions to the social reproduction dilemma and urge continued support for progressive policy responses.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Neoliberalism; feminist political economy; social reproduction; daily life; primitive accumulation";
ID;"SOCIAL REPRODUCTION; GENDER";
AB;By centralizing the material foundations of daily life, the burgeoning 'Everyday IPE' literature has the capacity to make significant advances in achieving a more integrated political economy approach. The literature's theoretical framework, however, needs to be expanded to be able to adequately address the ways that households and reproductive relations are impacted by the global economy. Addressing this gap, this article attempts to carve out a heuristic space that can more clearly establish variations in the social and economic purpose of households over time and understand how these shifts have been shaped by, and shape, the social relations of capitalism. It then brings this framework to bear on the case study of Canadian neoliberal restructuring, demonstrating that through labour market and welfare restructuring, and the promotion of private and individual social reproduction strategies, the neoliberal state's aggressive reordering of people's daily lives extends too, into the household and spheres of reproduction.;

ID;"GLOBAL POLITICAL-ECONOMY; STATE; NEOLIBERALISM; MIGRATION; GENDER; CRIME; WORK";
AB;Warning of a global crisis of social reproduction, feminist IPE has come a long way to demonstrate how the restructuring of the global political economy increases obstacles to exercise social reproduction activities and thereby endangers social reproduction tout court. While feminist IPE explicitly points to the need for empirical studies of the ways in which this global crisis of social reproduction manifests itself in specific contexts, much of the literature remains rather theoretical and at the macro level. This article addresses this gap with a case study of the crisis of social reproduction in rural Mexico, focusing on the transformations of the conditions of social reproduction, gender regimes and the roles of children. The findings of this case study challenge the universal applicability of the '(re-)privatization of social reproduction' thesis. The main argument is that instead of emphasizing the shifts between the public and the private sphere and the retreat of the state from social provisioning, it is essential to reorient our focus towards the changing and context-specific forms of state involvement, and their implications for the transformation of social reproduction conditions, if we are to gain a better understanding of the variety of ways in which the global crisis of social reproduction manifests itself in different locations.;

It finds that, like Benjamin Cohen's depiction of the American school, IPE in the United States is increasingly positivist, quantitative, and liberal in orientation. It employs data from a journal article database that tracks trends in publication patterns. It also analyzes data from two surveys of IR scholars in the United States and Canada that were conducted in the fall of 2006.;

The 'new IPE', as embodied in the open economy politics approach, is more rigorous and has the virtue of integrating comparative and international political economy into a common framework. But it pays too little attention both to how interests are constructed and how policies are subject to processes of international diffusion, and it is remarkably reluctant to focus on major changes taking place in world politics. IPE should come to grips with the fact that genuine economic development is taking place on a global scale; on the role of China, on volatility in financial and energy markets; on the role of actor other than states, and on the implications of the Internet for the analysis of power.";

ID;"INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL-ECONOMY; AMERICAN SCHOOL; TRANSATLANTIC DIVIDE; MARKETS";
AB;Beginning from the Teaching, Research, and International Politics (TRIP) survey, this paper outlines the most important emerging paradigm in international political economy (IPE), known as open economy politics (OEP). This approach forms the core of the 'American' school of IPE. The paper then contrasts the epistemology of OEP, based on partial equilibrium analysis, with that of the 'British' school of IPE, which favors a more holistic approach. This difference is not captured well in the TRIP survey, nor is it particularly well understood by many proponents of either side. Recognizing the progressive nature of the OEP research program, the essay concludes with a call to bridge but not necessarily to abolish the transatlantic divide.;

ID;"LIBERAL LEGACIES; FOREIGN-AFFAIRS; KANT; FORM";
AB;This paper explores disjunctures between ontology and methodology in the American school to better understand both the limits of this approach and ways we can counter its blind spots. Tierney and Maliniak's TRIP data point to a strong elective affinity between, on the one hand, rationalist/liberal ontological assumptions and quantitative methodologies, and on the other, constructivist assumptions and qualitative methodologies. This affinity is neither natural nor obvious, as is discussed. It also raises deeper issues for the field about the nature of causation. As a variety of philosophers of science have insisted, we need to do much better in thinking about the relationship between our underlying notions of causation and the methodological tools that we employ. By so doing, we will not only be able to better build social-scientific knowledge, but also better help bridge the empirical-normative gap that Cohen identifies. More broadly, the paper suggests that by combining a more thoughtful approach to causation with a broadly pragmatist approach to the philosophy of science we can both remedy some of the defects of the American school of international political economy, and provide some pointers to the British school, too.;

DE;"Constructivism; Gilpin; intellectual monoculture; IPE theory; IPE training; methodology; ontology";
AB;The intellectual monoculture that we currently observe in American IPE, based upon an allegiance to liberalism, rationalism and quantitative methodology, is a misguided departure from the pluralism that once defined the discipline. This monoculture is evident in the way we currently train graduate students in IPE and in the gatekeeping practices of the leading international relations journals. Fortunately, there is a continued diversity of work appearing in other fora from that surveyed by Maliniak and Tierney, primarily in book form and in alternative journals. The absence of cross-fertilization from these alternative outlets to the high status journals and graduate syllabi portends poorly for the future of the field. Like agricultural crops susceptible to devastating collapse for lack of diversification, an intellectual monoculture in IPE may be unable to effectively respond to the dramatic changes and critical emerging issues in the world economy today.;

AB;In this essay, I draw attention to what I see as a slow death of theoretical, methodological and empirical pluralism in American-school international political economy (IPE). In the first instance, I identify its roots in practices of editorial gatekeeping among the leading journals and the self-selection of authors who publish in them, and on this basis put forward a set of sceptical reactions to Maliniak and Tierney's contention that we can adequately depict the 'state of the field' by analyzing the content of the 'top' journals. I go on to explore the implications of the close disciplinary association of IPE with the discipline of international relations in the United States, and argue that the marked contraction of pluralism in the American school of IPE is due in large part to its continued shackling to international relations as much as its emerging methodological monoculture.;

AB;"This article challenges three aspects of the 'American' school of international political economy (IPE) as presented by Benjamin Cohen and further elaborated by Dan Maliniak and Michael Tierney in this special issue. First, I question whether their depiction of the field is accurate. What they describe is not so much the 'American' school of IPE, but the 'Harvard' school. IPE in America is a rich and varied enterprise; not so the 'Harvard' school. Second, and unfortunately, IPE in America is also highly centralized and hierarchical, and this gives the 'Harvard' school enormous latitude to influence the self-depiction of the field and in some ways also its trajectory. This is not healthy, either for IPE scholarship in America or beyond. Finally, notwithstanding the power and authority of the 'Harvard' school, we outside of America cannot abandon IPE to its grip. My suggested course of action is to continue engaging with those of our colleagues (both within and outside of this school) who are receptive to the wide-ranging pursuit of knowledge and who recognize that IPE is a field defined by its subject matter rather than by its commitment to a particular methodology.";

The history of economics from interwar pluralism to postwar neoclassicism should sound warning bells about IPE following this path. Neoclassical economics has built-in biases in favor of self-adjusting systems and American hegemony; and biases against attention to inequalities of income and power, and against states' retaining power to shape internal arrangements within frontier controls. The transformation of economics also raises pertinent questions about IPE's shaping by its 'patrons', in the form of university administrators, government officials, business groups, and foundations.";

AB;This paper responds to two issues raised in this special issue on the American school of international political economy (IPE). I react first to the assumed convergence towards an open economy politics (OEP) framework. While OEP clearly has merits, I find that its narrow conception of actors and interests neglects other approaches' insights into preference formation and institutions that would enable it to offer better explanations of political economy. Second, I respond to the perceived monoculture in American IPE, which many (wrongly) attribute to professional power over journals and (rightly) tie to graduate training in the United States. More to the point of deconstructing the perceived intellectual hegemony driving IPE's monoculture, I challenge Randall Germain's indictment of the Harvard school of IPE. I show that the early Harvard Mafia indeed played a critical role in shaping the field, but it did not determine the myopic paradigmatic and methodological trends we currently see in the discipline. Finally, I reflect on why we have, and indeed need, this transatlantic debate and make a plea for more pragmatism, pluralism and problem-driven research in IPE today.;

Fourth, what can and should be done about the divide?;

ID;"WESTERN-EUROPE; EXTREME-RIGHT; TRADE-POLICY; PARTIES; DEMOCRACIES; EXPANSION; ECONOMY; SUPPORT; WELFARE; SUCCESS";
AB;This paper investigates political-economic backlash to economic globalization in industrialized polities. It analyzes data on the content of party platforms to develop measures of party support for, or opposition to, political-economic closure, anti-democratic nationalism, and xenophobia in all party platforms of 23 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries for all national elections between 1960 and 2003. These allow broader judgments of trends in autarky and autarchy than focusing on electoral success of particular extreme-right parties. Based on these measures, the paper quantitatively analyzes how international trade and capital openness and flows, and immigration flows, all influence the embrace or rejection of political-economic backlash among parties. The main explanatory finding is that immigration and capital flows and openness tend to increase marginally such backlash when national welfare compensation is very modest, but to reduce it when national compensation is generous, cushioning citizens from globalization's economic risks. This finding provides evidence that the current wave of globalization only marginally resembles the dark politics ending its nineteenth-century predecessor, and that welfare protection may help make the difference between political-economic backlash and liberalism in contemporary globalization.;

ID;"FINANCIAL-INDUSTRIAL GROUPS; EMERGING MARKETS; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES; OWNERSHIP; EMERGENCE";
AB;Diversified business groups are present in nearly all economies and dominate the private sector in most developing countries. This article seeks to add to existing theories, primarily economic and sociological, by analyzing the policies and state actions that promote and sustain business groups, and contribute to significant cross-national variations among them along dimensions of size, range of diversification, and reactions to globalization. The political economy explanation presented here emphasizes the role of politics and policy - especially regulatory policies and overall development strategies - in setting the external parameters of variation among groups, and also incorporates additional internal economic logics ( economies of scope and risk reduction). This political economic approach helps distinguish the core logics of three main kinds of business groups - organic, portfolio, and policy-induced - that have reacted differently to recent trends in market reform and globalization.;

ID;"CORN LAWS; GROWTH; REPEAL; FRANCE; GUILDS; DETERMINANTS; INSTITUTIONS; 19TH-CENTURY; REVOLUTION; INNOVATION";
AB;The article examines Mancur Olson's claim that the rise and decline of nations is intrinsically intertwined with the build-up of vested interests in the economy. I contend that Olson must be supplemented with Joseph Schumpeter for a theoretical framework that enables us to examine processes of long-term structural economic change. The specific focus is on technological progress and industrial growth, with a view to analyzing why certain nations have been better able to rise to industrial leadership, and staying there, than others. The framework yields one theoretical proposition, which receives broad empirical support: In order to rise to industrial leadership, states must prevent vested interests from blocking structural change. States that are unable to do this will get locked into yesterday's technologies and industries, and will effectively have consigned themselves to long-term stagnation and decline. The empirical support is derived from the second part of the article, where paired comparisons between Britain, France, Germany, the US and Japan for five core industries during five periods of industrial leadership, from the Industrial Revolution until today, provide a qualitative test of the theory.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Migration; transnational division of labor; labor mobility; development; inequality; Americas; Caribbean basin";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; LATIN-AMERICA; LABOR-MARKET; REMITTANCES; STATES";
AB;In the context of a severe contraction of 'development space' for Latin American and Caribbean economies in the global political economy, we are witnessing a novel and increasingly explicit articulation of migration as a national development strategy by governments in the region. This is particularly pronounced in the Caribbean basin ( defined to include Mexico). In response to the shifting shape of the transnational division of labor, the core development strategy that is being articulated is one of insertion into transnational supply chains on the basis of the provision of labor, in the sense both of populating the new transnational professional workforce and of ensuring a continual supply of cheap, low- or unskilled, often undocumented workers to a huge range of sectors in cities and outside them. This article contends that what is thereby put in place is a new political economy of inequality in the Americas, through which a dominant, transnationalized form of 'accumulation by dispossession' can be reinforced and deepened. This transnationalized form of accumulation by dispossession combines, in highly contingent ways, with the distinctively 'nationalized' governance of migration to constitute a contemporary political economy of migration in the Americas in which the developmental potential of labor mobility is subject to profound constraints.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
DE;"Asia; environment; foreign direct investment; Japan; pollution havens; social movements";
ID;INDUSTRY;
AB;Most economists examining the question of 'pollution havens' have concluded that the level of environmental regulation and activism in different states is not generally a significant determinant of international patterns of trade and foreign direct investment. This paper argues on the basis of extensive primary research that with respect to Japan's foreign direct investment during the 1970s, at any rate, this conclusion needs to be rethought. In the early 1970s, Japanese actors were remarkably forthright in ascribing their investment decisions to a desire to move polluting industry overseas. These statements allow us to examine 'pollution export' as a state strategy, a project advocated by industry organizations, and a response of individual firms to high levels of protest and regulation. The paper also traces the development of the Japanese debate over pollution export through the 1970s.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Asian Development Bank; conditionalities; democracy; Kerala; India";
ID;"INDIA; GROWTH; STATE";
AB;This case study of the implications of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan on the Indian state of Kerala explores how neoliberal reforms have impacted on the state's much-acclaimed social model of development. Notwithstanding resistance, the state moves towards market-driven reforms wherein external funds are privileged over internal resources, the reasons for which are probed within the context of social structures of accumulation and emergent power relations. It is argued that with the diversion of resources towards debt servicing and compliance with policy conditionalities, the collaboration with the ADB is likely to undermine social democracy. What ensues is a double collapse: a collapse of the Kerala Model of social development and the demise of an iconized Left. This paper thus contributes, first, to the growing literature on the political-economic repercussions of Structural Adjustment Programs in developing regions and second, to the limited scholarship on the adoption of right-wing neoliberal policies by social democratic governments.;

ID;"TRANSATLANTIC DIVIDE; IPE";
AB;"Benjamin J. Cohen's story of the transatlantic divide in IPE follows a simple plot, creating expectations concerning the outcome and culmination of this process. The conclusion is not predictable - there is no story unless our attention is being held in suspense by contingencies - but it must be acceptable. In Cohen's story, the expectation created is that IPE will follow American positivism and theories but involves 'British' moral judgements and sentiments of justice. However, there are better ways of telling better stories about the history and future of Global Political Economy. First, the methodological dividing line is essentially false, i.e. based on an anachronistic understanding of science. Causal explanation involves hermeneutical understanding; and does not imply predictions in the sense of positivism. Second, I argue that the rise of IPE should be read in terms of debates on political economy that have continued since the eighteenth century and have never been limited to Britain and the United States. The rise of new Political Economy in politics, sociology, business studies and other fields is a challenge to the hegemony of orthodox neoclassical economics. Analogically to the time of the Great Depression when collective learning did occur and largely in Keynesian terms, the on-going and future learning is contingent also on the consequences of the orthodox dominance in policy-making.";

AB;This comment suggests that Cohen's account of the history and present approaches to IPE as divided into an American and a British school is unduly narrow. It excludes not only Europe and the rest of the world but more centrally lines of lines of theorizing that have shaped and can continue to shape IPE ( also within the Anglo-Saxon world). It proceeds to argue that embracing a broader view of IPE is important. It ensures for the quality, relevance and vitality of the field. The comment concludes that although a de-coupling of Cohen's version of IPE and the rest would seem tempting and logical it is unlikely to happen for reasons of politics, academic and international.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DE;"Globalization; policy alliances; financial markets; Malaysia; Taiwan";
ID;POLITICS;
AB;The past two decades have witnessed the exponential growth of stock markets and the significant market orientation of financial systems in Malaysia and Taiwan. These changes were well underway prior to the Asian crisis of 1997-98 but have been consolidated and accelerated by post-crisis reforms that have further institutionalized market-oriented practices. However, the changing patterns of financial markets have not preordained convergence towards the Anglo-American model of capitalism and have shown significant divergences from financial liberalism. Challenging the market-driven convergence and historical institutionalist models, this article locates the political sources of changing financial structures within the interaction between international structural forces and domestic interest alliances of private and public actors. This interactive process has not only oriented the national financial architecture towards securities markets but also made market-oriented changes different from the neo-liberal paradigm.;

AB;"Turkey has experienced consecutive financial crises in 2000 and 2001. The crisis of 2001 was particularly far-reaching in terms of its impact, resulting in a major collapse of output and employment. It was also quite distinct in terms of its income distributional consequences in the sense that not only the wage earners, but all sections of society at varying degrees encountered its negative consequences. The crisis also provided an avenue for a new wave of neo-liberal restructuring with a major emphasis on regulatory reforms. Turkey's political economy in the post-2001 era is investigated on the basis of four key inter-related elements: the impact of the IMF and the World Bank; the restructuring of the state's relationship with the domestic financial sector especially through regulatory reforms; the opening up of Turkey to foreign direct investment; and the adoption of a wide range of reforms modelled on the European Union, in line with the goal of entry into the EU. Indeed, the regional context associated with EU conditionality has provided the political focus of the process as a whole. A key hypothesis is that Turkey continues to be vulnerable in spite of the fact that the banking sector is much more tightly regulated in line with international norms during the post-crisis era.";

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Russia; state-economy relations; virtual economy; financial crisis; resource curse";
ID;"GLOBAL ECONOMY; CRISIS; REFORM; OIL";
AB;Russia's experience of financial crisis has been novel: crisis was followed by growth rather than depression, and did not lead to any increased role for foreign economic agencies or actors in Russia's economy. This novel experience resulted from the structure of Russia's economy in the 1990s, the limited role of financial intermediation in the Russian economy and rising oil prices. Consequently, the chief outcome of crisis has been political, the renewal of central political authority and a reining in of major economic interests. This has helped to solve the problem of state finances, which was the source of the 1998 crisis, but neither economic growth nor increased central political authority have managed to deal with the problem of capital deficiency in Russia so that it remains dependent on energy exports to continue growing. Potentially, this leaves Russia exposed to 'resource curse' problems. While these have been avoided so far, the absence of constraints on political leaders might lead to such problems in the future.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DT;Article;
DE;"Sovereign debt; restructuring; creditors; time horizons; reputations; Argentina";
ID;"SOVEREIGN DEBT; MARKETS; SPREADS";
AB;Although a recurrent phenomenon, sovereign debt restructurings following defaults on debt obligations do not engender today the exact same dynamics they did in the past. On the one hand, prevalent reputational models have overestimated the costs of default in terms of access to new credit. On the other hand, debtors' restructuring strategies have been underestimated in the face of anticipated constraints on developing countries' policy autonomy believed to flow from financial globalization. By focusing on the latest Argentine debt restructuring (the largest and most complex in history to date), I find that the outcome of sovereign debt restructurings in terms of credit (re) access are much less contingent on market punishments based on reputations than on the short-term nature of financial incentives in the bond industry as well as on international lending cycles. Time horizons play a crucial role in how debtors take advantage of different creditors' incentives to participate in a restructuring. A critical implication is that governments have more room to maneuver in taking contentious policy stances (such as stringent debt restructuring deals) than the literature on economic globalization accounts for. Also, far from a zero-sum game, for both debtors and some of their creditors, debt restructurings can prove to be attractive deals for their specific purposes.;

ID;"POLITICS; FINANCE; GLOBALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; STATE";
AB;"Why in the wake of the Asian financial crisis have certain emerging market states (EMs) proved more proficient in the implementation of advanced economic reforms than others, despite similar crisis experiences, similar stages of economic development, similar pressure from external actors (both political and market-based), and - most significantly - similar interests in preventing recurrence? The article seeks to account for this paradoxical divergence in state responses to financial crisis conditions and in so doing help compensate for the paucity of crisis response studies in the literature; it seeks to explain why states with numerous similarities are nonetheless responding differently. The evidence appears to confirm that EMs are more likely to implement a significant range of reforms where the 'antecedents of good governance' are positive (see below); conversely, where the antecedents of EM governance are negative, attempts to implement the requisite regulatory changes have foundered. In either case, an interaction effect with degree of democracy is discernable with respect to each of the antecedents of good governance. Without the domestic forms called for here, not to mention necessary reforms of the international financial architecture, a contagion of even global proportions is not only possible but probable.";

ID;"ETHNIC FRACTIONALIZATION; CAPITALISM; VARIETIES; GROWTH; TRUST";
AB;Building on insights from Katzenstein and Gellner, the authors theorize that small, culturally homogeneous countries with a strong national identity have institutional advantages that tend to enhance their long-term socioeconomic performance. They can coordinate policy in ways that help them respond successfully to external vulnerabilities by building institutional capacities for cooperation, sacrifice, flexible maneuvering, and concerted state action in the national interest. The emphasis on culture and national identity is an important innovation in understanding the political economy of small states. The theory is illustrated by means of an extended analysis of Denmark.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"International organizations; tax havens; constructivism; regulation; speech acts; reputation";
AB;This article argues that public blacklisting by international organizations can be an effective means of bringing about compliance in otherwise recalcitrant states. This contention is examined in light of overlapping campaigns by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Financial Action Task Force to pressure targeted states to adopt costly financial reforms. In a constructivist vein, blacklisting is held to be a form of speech act that changed the world by damaging states' reputations among investors, and thus produced pressure to comply through actual or anticipated capital flight. To be removed from blacklists, thereby preventing future economic damage, those targeted have had to comply with stringent regulatory standards mandated by these international organizations. Evidence is taken from interviews, press accounts, official documents and quantitative data relating to seven affected tax havens as well as Austria and Switzerland.;

ID;"FUTURE; WTO";
AB;"Warnings that a breakdown in multilateral trade liberalization would bring about an upsurge in protectionist sentiment, the possible collapse of the multilateral trading system and, in the most doomsday of scenarios, the fragmentation of the global economy have been an intrinsic part of trade negotiations since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was first negotiated. What is seldom acknowledged, however, is the role that this language of crisis and collapse - what might be called a 'crisis discourse' - has had on framing trade negotiations and in maintaining forward momentum in the liberalization process. This discourse has played a role in facilitating the kind of institutional development that the GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO) has undergone - helping to push through bargains among GATT contracting parties and WTO members that have been (and remain) deeply asymmetrical - and driving the trade agenda forward at moments when the institution appears deadlocked; and it has continued to play a role in the current round of negotiations.";
;The aims of the paper are twofold. First, the paper explores the content of the crisis discourse. Second, it examines the way in which the discourse has been deployed as a means of reframing trade negotiations in such a way that the likelihood of their continuation and ultimate conclusion increases. The paper does this by focusing on the collapse and resumption of the negotiations in the wake of the WTO's 2005 Hong Kong ministerial meeting, though the crisis discourse and its intensification at moments of intransigence has been a key feature of trade negotiations since the Allies first sat down to develop a trade architecture in the wartime and early post-war years.;

LA;English;

DE;"Economic nationalism; globalization; India; industry transformation";
ID;"AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; UNEVEN; POLICY; STATE";
AB;With increasing economic interdependence, the scholarly treatment as well as the practice of economic nationalism is either seen as theoretically redundant or practically impossible. Contrary to this conclusion, I argue that economic nationalism is not inconsistent with globalization. States are not only active participants in globalization but they continue to strategically express nationalism in new global settings by supporting national firms and citizens overseas. By redefining economic nationalism from protectionism to the leveraging of national resources to secure economic benefits from the world economy, this paper provides an alternative view of economic nationalism. This paper analyzes economic nationalism as a dynamic concept. Empirically, it takes up three Indian industries (steel, auto, software) since 1950 to understand how nationalism was practiced and how it has changed under globalization. The paper establishes India's pursuit of economic nationalism under globalization through its support of Indian businesses and citizens abroad. Though the coherence of nationalism may be weak, it can still be expressed in looser forms of national 'presence' abroad.;

AB;Bilateral and multilateral donors have made poverty reduction a principal goal of their aid interventions in Haiti. At the same time donors continue to promote an outward looking development strategy based on ideological adherence to neoliberal precepts. Due to its acute dependence on aid, Haiti's government must therefore design an economic development plan which satisfies the renewed poverty reduction imperative but which is not at variance with processes of globalization and neoliberalmarket rules. Donors are supporting one economic development strategy which they believe fits the bill: the reactivation of the country's export processing zones (EPZs). This article considers Haiti's past experience with EPZs as well as the model's impact on the region as a whole, in order to show it is unlikely to decrease poverty in any significant way or alleviate the country's socioeconomic inequalities. The Haiti case also highlights a disturbing state of affairs: it is the governments of the poorest countries that have the least number of policy tools and options available to combat misery and destitution. The renewed poverty reduction consensus does not alter this stark reality.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"EU preferential trade; ACP; development; WTO; sugar; capital accumulation";
ID;"SYSTEM; POLICY";
AB;In 2005 the EU instigated the most substantial reform to the sugar sector since the UK acceded in 1973 and just two years later caused consternation among the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries by denouncing the 34-year long Sugar Protocol. In contrast to existing literature, which has taken a snapshot of the post-reform period and identified 'winners and losers' accordingly, this article examines the processes of capital accumulation in the industry and the legacies these have left. It argues that despite defeat in a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute case, concentration and diversification in the EU sugar industry has enabled its leading corporations to prosper after reform, while divestment in the ex-colonies has left producers in the ACP facing difficulties of adjustment far in excess of plain terms of trade losses. Further, it also reveals why EU reform was not solely a response to WTO legislation but rather, because of the relationship of sugar to wider economic fortunes, resulted from an assiduous attempt by the EU Trade Commission to press the sector into a WTO-compatible Common Agricultural Policy.;

ID;"DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; EASTERN-EUROPE; GENERAL-THEORY; CONSENSUS; INDUSTRIALIZATION; IMPERFECTIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; INSTITUTIONS; PERFORMANCE";
AB;This essay critically reviews an important new school of thought in the 'post-Washington' era, that of Professor Dani Rodrik and his collaborators. The review first provides some background on the substantive differences between the Washington Consensus and more heterodox development paradigms, such as Robert Wade's East Asian revisionism. The paper then outlines Rodrik's own developmental vision, which could be termed a third way inasmuch as it borrows elements from both orthodox and heterodox schools of thought, yet disagrees with some of the central underpinnings of both. The remainder of the paper then critically assesses some key elements of this alternative vision, especially Rodrik's institutionalist revision of the existing growth evidence, his call for greater democratization as a universal institutional reform and his proposed changes to the way in which technocrats should formulate policy advice in a post-Washington era.;

DE;"China; United States; WTO; sovereign wealth funds; state capitalism";
ID;"EAST-ASIA; GLOBALIZATION; RETURN; EMPIRE; POWER";
AB;The remarkable economic rise of China and the recent turmoil in US financial markets inevitably raises questions about the respective fortunes of both countries. This paper assess the relative standing of the US and China by placing their relationship in historical context. It is suggested that China's accession to the WTO marked the highpoint of US influence and ascendancy. Since then, China's position has been steadily improving, something that the recent emergence of its first sovereign wealth fund and its subsequent role in bailing out distressed US financial institutions has dramatically highlighted. If China's form of 'state capitalism' continues to become more influential it will have major consequences for not only the US, but for the extant geopolitical order more generally.;

DT;Article;
DE;"MERCOSUR; regionalism; regional cooperation; domestic politics; trade disputes";
ID;"ECONOMIC-INTEGRATION; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; SOUTHERN CONE; COALITIONS; ARGENTINA; DIPLOMACY; AMERICA";
AB;This article seeks to account for the erratic patterns of conflict and cooperation observed inMERCOSUR since 1995. It argues that the marked deterioration of trade and diplomatic relations between Argentina and Brazil in the late 1990s and early 2000s is best explained in reference to domestic political constraints on inter-state cooperation. Two domestic-level dynamics shaped the national preferences for regional cooperation of Argentina and Brazil: state-society relations and intra-state cleavages. The recurrent instances of defection in the late 1990s reflected not only societal pressure but also the macroeconomic and political calculations of national policymakers. Tension among different state agencies sharing power over regional policy-making further undermined the coherence of member states' behavior toward their regional commitments. This 'second-image' explanation of conflict in MERCOSUR is illustrated with case studies of three major trade disputes between Argentina and Brazil: the 1995 automobile sector crisis, the 1999 footwear industry dispute and the 2001 conflict over the common external tariff.;

ID;"UNITED-STATES; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; POLICY; COMPETITION; SPILLOVERS; FIRMS";
AB;Do industries seek trade protection against foreign competition in the form of inward foreign direct investment (FDI)? Some studies argue that the influx of FDI may alter the existing structure of competition and defuse firm-level pressure for trade protection. On the other hand, theories that view FDI as a form of strategic rivalry among firms of different national origins suggest that increasing FDI causes greater industry demands for trade protection. This paper empirically tests these competing claims using data on the initiation of antidumping investigations in the US. Its findings show that FDI increases industry demand for trade protection. This result lends support to arguments emphasizing the competitive challenge FDI poses to domestic firms.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Globalization; North-South trade; unequal exchange; deindustrialization; economic growth";
ID;"EXPLAINING DEINDUSTRIALIZATION; GLOBALIZATION; GROWTH; INDUSTRIALIZATION; ECONOMIES";
AB;Using a novel extension of unequal exchange theory, this study analyzes how international trade affects per-capita incomes and employment patterns in affluent countries. The study begins by demonstrating that workers in less-developed countries are significantly underpaid relative to their labor productivity, and that this outcome causes the monetary values of goods exported from these countries to underestimate the actual amount of labor inputs embodied within them. From this observation, it is hypothesized that North-South trade, unlike North-North trade, should increase per-capita incomes in affluent countries, while also reducing employment in their manufacturing sectors. Using a simultaneous equations model, the study compares this theoretical expectation to the actual experiences of 18 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries between 1970 and 2003. The results are generally consistent with expectations. The study concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings.;

DE;"Trade; cleavages; tariff reform";
ID;"FACTOR MOBILITY; INCOME";
AB;In 1903, Joseph Chamberlain argued that tariffs would protect jobs in Britain and improve the government's fiscal position. The Liberals countered by not only defending free trade, but proposing land reform. Recent analyses fail to account for the cleavages exposed between 1903 and 1910. The dominant cleavage divided the country along the lines of agricultural sectors, but was cross-cut by a factor-based cleavage in urban areas. This pattern is explained by the Liberals' policies on land use and taxes, which altered voters' evaluations of the impact of trade.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Ideas; policy change; IMF; capital account liberalization";
ID;"EMERGING MARKETS; IMF";
AB;The paper explores a case of failure of economic ideas at bringing about institutional change. Specifically, it investigates the mechanism of legitimacy feedback that facilitated and, later, prevented the policy idea of orderly liberalization from being institutionalized into the amendment of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Articles that would have extended the Fund's mission to the liberalization of capital flows. Drawing on archival research and interviews with IMF officials, the paper argues that the convergence of member countries' expectations around the proposal to amend the Articles was the product of the interaction between IMF-sponsored ideas and the validation of those actors that make up the Fund's social constituencies for legitimation within a specific historical context. The idea of orderly liberalization was consequential not because it was supported by the United States or backed up by a homogenous IMF staff, but because it reflected the economic interests of those actors - member states and private sector - who would bear the costs of an extension of the Fund's mission.;

DE;"Scale; multi-level governance; state; societal relations with nature; genetic resources; TRIPs Agreement";
ID;"SOCIOSPATIAL RELATIONS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; GOVERNANCE; GEOGRAPHY; URBAN; GLOBALIZATION; SPATIALITIES; ACCUMULATION; EUROPE; LIMITS";
AB;The scale debate has significantly enhanced our understanding of the spatial dimensions of the transformations of statehood. Its crucial merit lies in a process-based understanding of scale which helps to overcome the limitations of more static concepts like multi-level governance. More recently, the usefulness of the scale concept, as well as the relationship between scale and other spatial categories, has been increasingly discussed. This paper aims to contribute to these discussions from the perspective of amaterialist state theory. The paper's argument is that the scale concept needs further clarification with respect to its understanding of hegemony, the national state and societal relations with nature. It elaborates this argument by analyzing the rescaling of the protection of intellectual property rights on genetic resources, with particular reference to the WTO-TRIPs Agreement. The paper concludes by stating that the production of new spatial scales of the state can be an important element in the reorganization of control over nature. However, the strong structural selectivities in favor of dominant social and political forces which characterize international state apparatuses negatively affect their hegemonic capacity. Thus, the role of national states in the regulation of contradictory social forces remains crucial and may even be strengthened by processes of rescaling.;

DE;"Financialization; political economy; varieties of capitalism; social accounting; regulationism";
ID;"SHAREHOLDER VALUE; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; UNITED-STATES; AGENCY COSTS; INVESTMENT; FINANCE; MARKET; ACCUMULATION; INFORMATION; PROMISES";
AB;A number of important contributions to the political economy literature have argued that changes in the financial sector have been amongst the main reflections, or even the driving forces, of recent transformations of capitalism in the rich countries. This hypothesis has been referred to as 'financialization'. This article argues that the interdisciplinary literature can be enriched if the macroeconomic dimension of financialization is more explicitly taken into account. In particular, important macroeconomic constraints regarding the determination of profits, in the face of a decreasing importance of physical investment and an increased importance of financial operations, are often not explicitly considered. The author compares his macroeconomic approach with contributions from different strands in the existing literature, including empirical analyses of new patterns of profit generation, the 'varieties of capitalism' approach, the British 'social accounting' literature, and the French 'regulationist' literature. The author's theoretical framework is illustrated by means of an empirical comparison of the effects of financialization in the USA and in Germany.;

ID;"TRANSITIONAL ECONOMY; LOCAL-GOVERNMENTS; ASIAN CRISIS; INDUSTRIAL; INVESTMENT; STATE";
AB;This paper assesses the sources of potential instability of China's political economy by expositing the limits of the post-Mao regime of capital accumulation in historical and comparative perspectives. It argues that the new spatial and socio-political orders under this regime, while propelling China's economic miracle, also contribute to the internalization of the global overaccumulation crisis, which has been haunting the world capitalist system since the late 1960s, into China's national economy. Whereas decentralization of regulatory authority of the state accelerates overinvestment among local economic agents, breakdown of the Maoist social compact and the subsequent class polarization foster underconsumption. The resulting structural imbalance of the economy leads to the risk of falling profit across key sectors and China's over-reliance on the export market, the expansion of which has hinged much on the debt-financed and unsustainable consumption spree in the US. A full-fledged overaccumulation crisis within China in the form of extensive bankruptcy of enterprise, surging unemployment and financial turmoil will certainly trigger extensive global repercussions, given China's weight in the global economy. This crisis, nonetheless, is not inevitable, and can plausibly be averted through a recentralization of the state's economic regulatory functions and income redistribution. No matter whether and how such a crisis unfolds, nonetheless, it is not likely to stop the shift of the center of gravity of global capitalism to Asia in the long run.;

ID;"FAILURE; SOMALIA; SOVEREIGNTY; COLLAPSE";
AB;"The notion of 'failed states' has gained widespread currency in political and academic discourse. This article contributes to a critique of the 'failed states' discourse. It identifies methodological flaws in the 'failed states' discourse which undermine its explanatory power, and proposes an alternative framework for analysing conditions of social crisis in neocolonial states, rooted in global political economy. This paper focuses on conditions of crisis in Africa. The discourse of 'state failure' characterises conditions of crisis as local in origin, the product of culture or poor leadership. The current condition of structural crisis in so many of Africa's neocolonial states must be situated in the imperial history of global capitalism. This requires examining the legacy of colonial transformation; the specific form of the postcolonial state, society and economy after independence, which tended in many cases to give rise to factional struggles and authoritarian rule; and the ways in which such 'internal' social tensions and contradictions have been reinforced by the global political economy, both the geo-politics of the Cold War and the contradictions of global capitalism. The argument is developed through examination of the specific case of Somalia.";

DE;"bioprospecting; benefit-sharing; governmentality; post-development; subsistence; 'Intellectual Property Rights'";
ID;"SOUTH-AFRICA; POLITICS; TRADE";
AB;It is becoming difficult to justify fears around biopiracy due to contemporary developments, which would see the inclusion of those previously marginalized by modernization. The World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) role in this is central. WIPO seeks to bypass the state by negotiating the developmental aspirations of local communities via the alienation of Traditional Knowledge (TK). The new developmental strategy diverges from strategies of redistribution by privatizing returns from bioprospecting to select contractual partners. The WIPO TK Report facilitates this by reconstructing TK holders as owners of alienable assets. However, what underlies this incorporation of reconstructed 'premoderns' is the unspoken belief around modernization that poverty is the inevitable lot of premoderns who are yet to be incorporated into global capitalism. However, WIPO's discursive construction of the 'premodern' development aspirant is achieved by excluding displaced identities. WIPO's bioprospecting agreements demand that signatories have delimited identities. Hence exclusivity ensures that revenues are not dissipated amongst an unknown number of people who could claim entitlements to commercial returns. The workability of a contract is achieved by the exclusion of creolized identities inscribed by modernization's displacement. This has dire implication for biodiversity-dependent poor communities whose livelihood strategies are shaped in response to displacement.;

TI;The politics of establishing pro-poor accountability: What can poverty reduction strategies achieve?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;

DT;Article;
DE;"Poverty Reduction Strategies; accountability; participation; politics; Bolivia; Zambia";
ID;"CONDITIONALITY; PARTICIPATION; LIBERALISM; NGOS; AID";
AB;The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) experiment, along with other innovations promoted by the international financial institutions over the past decade, has promised to secure pro-poor forms of accountability in relation to development policy-making. New consultative processes and new forms of conditionality each promise to re-order relationships between poor citizens and their governments, and between governments and donors respectively. Using evidence from Bolivia and Zambia, we identify three critical problems with these claims. First, there is a tendency to focus on promoting accountability mechanisms that are largely discretionary and lack significant disciplinary power, particularly those reliant on certain forms of civil society participation. Second, donors have failed to overcome the contradictions regarding the role of extra-national actors in securing accountability mechanisms within particular states. Third, there is a tendency within the PRS experiment to overlook the deeper forms of politics that might underpin effective accountability mechanisms in developing countries. Ensuring accountability is not simply a technocratic project, but rather is critical for a substantive politics of democratization which goes to the heart of the wider contract between states and citizens. The PRS experiment, as located within a broader project of 'inclusive liberalism', reveals little potential to address this challenge.;

ID;"GROWTH; FEMINIZATION; INEQUALITY; ECONOMY; TRADE; WORLD; COSTS; LABOR";
AB;Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) have not been very successful in gender mainstreaming. This article will show, with examples from the PRSPs of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, how gender issues have been largely ignored in the design, poverty analysis, and policy actions of PRSPs. It will be argued that the reason for this failure is only partially a lack of political will and gender expertise on the side of the governments and PRS teams. Rather, the main reason for the failure of integrating gender in PRSPs is the overall framework of PRSPs, which does not allow for gender mainstreaming in macroeconomic policies. The core of the framework consists of narrowly defined macroeconomic targets and policies, while giving less importance to broader socio-economic objectives and policies. This, in turn, tends to shift gender entirely to a secondary, social concern, rather than being part and parcel of the core of the poverty reduction framework.;

DT;Article;
DE;"transatlantic divide; methodological competition; phenomenal world; IPE as hosting metaphor; new political economy";
AB;The following article is written as a sympathetic critique of Benjamin Cohen's recent identification in RIPE of incommensurable traditions of American and British IPE. It is also designed to engender further debate within the subject field on this most central of issues. Our argument is that scholars should beware the rigid terms in which Cohen identifies IPE's transatlantic divide, because simply by naming his two camps as polar opposites the invitation is open to others to entrench such an opposition in their own work. This would be regrettable enough had IPE already lapsed into the geographical division that Cohen describes. It is made more regrettable still by the fact that this is in any case an inaccurate account of the field which serves to marginalise much of the work that is currently at its cutting edge.;

AB;In a recent article in RIPE, Benjamin J. Cohen suggests that a deep divide exists between two schools of IPE: the American and the British. While, at a certain level of generality, obvious differences do exist between how international relations generally, and IPE more specifically, are studied in the US and the UK, various dimensions of Cohen's argument are problematic, and may inadvertently hinder his professed desire to build bridges across the Atlantic. In particular, Cohen's approach is ambiguous as to exactly what the defining characteristics of the 'British' approach are, appears to conflate different traditions of theorizing, and presents a very narrow characterization of the field of IPE in the United States.;

ID;INDUSTRIAL-POLICY;
AB;The Doha Round negotiations at the World Trade Organization have come to a halt. The vast majority of analyses of the (at least temporary) demise of the Doha Round have focused on the lack of the United States and the European Union to reach consensus on the agricultural proposals that were tabled during the round. Relatively little attention has focused on explaining the rationale for why a large part of the developing world would not agree to proposals on the table as well. Many developing country negotiators claim that the potential benefits of the Doha Round were relatively small while the potential costs in terms of a loss of sovereignty to deploy effective development policies were significant. This paper argues that developing countries took a respite from the negotiations because the possible gains from market access were not large enough to trade for giving up domestic policy space for development policy.;

ID;"CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; SHAREHOLDER VALUE; INNOVATION; COMMONS; REGIME";
AB;The increasing power of concentrated financial capital is accompanied by an extension of processes of commodification and procedures of dispossession similar to forms of original accumulation. This continuing and reinforced accumulation by dispossession in its different guises is capital's answer to the problem of over-accumulation. As a form of dispossessing accumulation, the implementation and extension of intellectual property monopolies is of particular importance. In the context of an increasing socialization of labor, in particular of innovative activities, the private appropriation of knowledge in the form of intellectual property monopolies and its commercial valorization has become a central characteristic of the current configuration of capitalism. Income based on such property titles has become an important form of the appropriation of resources in the finance-dominated accumulation regime. The article applies Marxian rent theory to intellectual property monopolies. Findings from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries illustrate how, based on specific power relations, the owners of property titles can appropriate resources and values. Rent extraction processes take place on different scales, from the enforcement of property monopolies over gene sequences to the role of the USA as a rentier state on a global scale.;

AB;There is growing international concern about the circulation of pathological viruses in the world economy. Reviewing recent scholarship on avian flu, SARS, and HIV/AIDS, this article argues that the contemporary world economy is generating not just an ecological footprint, but also an important epidemiological one. Illustrating the complex interdependencies that exist between economic and microbial systems of circulation, the article highlights the difficult challenges that states confront in trying to shield populations against these viruses within the current international order. Finally, the article also considers recent attempts to scale up international responses to these viruses, including their progressive securitization and the coming into force of a new set of international health regulations - opening up a new chapter in the bio-history of humanity.;

DE;"military privatization; mercenaries; governance; private security";
AB;The rise of the private military industry has become an important and controversial issue in international politics. This article reviews the contributions of four books that analyse the rise and consequences of the privatization of force. Placing military privatization in a broader political context shows how a fuller understanding of these developments requires a global focus and an emphasis on their relationship both to global capital and to shifting state forms where the public and the private, the domestic and the international, are being rearticulated.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"exchange rates; dollar dominance; international currency; global imbalances; monetary power; renminbi";
AB;The future of the dollar depends partly on China and the US being able to effectively manage the tensions arising from the large bilateral trade imbalance and the build-up of foreign exchange reserves by China. We argue that these tensions are unlikely to change over the medium term. While tensions can be managed, the possibilities for miscalculations and policy errors are significant given the complex, and sometimes inconsistent, interests of both countries' policy-makers. In fact, China faces its own form of a 'trilemma' and the ability of the US to exercise its monetary power by shifting the burden of adjustment onto China is uncertain. Given this, and volatile international financial markets, miscalculations which might result in a collapse in the value of the dollar affecting its role as an international currency become a real possibility.;

DE;"international currency; US dollar; Bretton Woods 2; euro; yen; sterling";
ID;"POWER; EURO";
AB;In recent years, the economic determinants of international currency status have attracted growing attention among economists. But what about the political determinants? This paper proposes a framework or taxonomy for thinking about this question. It identifies two distinct channels - one indirect and one direct - through which politics can influence the international standing of a currency. In the former category, politics is important through its impact on three key economic determinants of international currencies: confidence, liquidity, and transactional networks. In the latter category, politics matters more directly when a currency's international status is supported by states for reasons unrelated to these economic determinants. The paper explores briefly how these two channels of political influence might influence the dollar's future as an international currency. This exploration is not designed to provide a new definitive answer to the question of the dollar's future, but rather the goal is to highlight the various ways that political scientists can widen analyses of this topic.;

TI;Forbidden fruit: Russia's uneasy relationship with the US dollar;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"dollarization; Russia; exchange rates; ruble; international finance; monetary sovereignty";
AB;At the turn of the twenty-first century, Russia entered into a unique relationship with the US dollar: it became the only major country with both a highly dollarized economy and extensive dollar reserves. Russia also played a pivotal role in the international gas and oil markets, where resources are priced in and sold for US dollars. This paper argues, however, that three trends had converged by 2006 to challenge the US dollar's pre-eminence in Russia. First, President Vladimir Putin's efforts to strengthen the state required reasserting Russia's monetary sovereignty. Second, opposition to US foreign policy and a re-emergent Russian nationalism prompted many politicians to denounce Russia's dependence on the dollar. Finally, the dollar's increasing weakness internationally led Russian economic officials to worry that over-reliance on the dollar threatens Russia's economic stability. This relative weakness also encouraged ordinary Russians to rethink their relationship with the dollar. Together, these three trends led to a political anti-dollar campaign, gradual reserve diversification away from the dollar, and moves to substitute rubles or euros for dollars in domestic pricing, sales, and savings. This paper explores these trends and discusses their potential ramifications for the international dollar regime.;

DT;Article;
DE;"exchange rate; international currency; dollar dominance; Japan; regionalism; East Asia";
AB;The dollar dominance in East Asia has depended on its regional support. Japan's supportive policy toward the dollar, however, shifted in the late 1990s as the Japanese government began to address the region's heavy dependence on the dollar, which was regarded as one (but an important one) of the causes of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), by promoting the use of the yen in the region and regional monetary initiatives. Despite emerging signs of those challenges, Japan's domestic resistance and the region's power rivalry between Japan and China still makes the dollar the currency of choice in the medium term future.;

DE;"dollar dominance; international currency; hegemony";
ID;"UNITED-STATES; CURRENCY; SEIGNIORAGE; EURO";
AB;While the demise of the dollar has been predicted in the past, expectations of a fundamental change in the international role of the dollar are increasingly widespread, and eminently plausible. From a situation where the dollar was the undisputed and dominant international currency, one likely scenario is that it will become one of several key currencies that could be characterized as 'peer competitors'. This raises the question: does it matter? In particular, does it matter for US power? This paper reviews why the dollar's status might change, from that of a 'top' to a 'negotiated' currency. It then considers the consequences-the loss of economic benefits and structural power, and the costs associated with managing a currency in (relative) decline and eroding international prestige. I conclude that, even as the dollar is likely to remain the world's most widely used international currency, the vulnerability of the greenback presents a potentially significant and underappreciated restraint on contemporary American political and military predominance.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"European Union; Euro; dollar; power; constructivism; geopolitics";
ID;"SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; POLITICS; DOLLAR";
AB;Over the past few years, the dollar has been trading at historically low values against the Euro. Does the current trend indicate that the Euro is poised to challenge the long global supremacy of the American greenback? And how might currency rivalry reflect and shape the broader balance of power between the United States and the EU? The approach to the general relationship between power and currency is discussed, the determinants and characteristics of a key currency assessed, and the advantages and disadvantages that accrue to a key currency nation briefly reviewed. The current, and likely future, state of play in the global usage of the dollar, the Euro, and other major currencies are sketched out, stressing the interaction of material factors and the role of ideas and social processes in determining key currency status. On balance, the essay concludes that the Euro has many of the underlying economic factors that would make it a peer competitor to the dollar, but that the necessary political power and social requirements are missing to make it the focal point of the global economy. Nonetheless, observers of the transatlantic relationship should be on watch for indicators of a possible transformation in the Euro-dollar relationship.;

DE;"Japanese capitalism; institutional adaptation; institutional change; variety of capitalism; coordinated market economy";
ID;"CAPITALISM; VARIETIES";
AB;This article reviews the contributions of three important books that analyze, respectively, the sources and patterns of institutional inertial, adjustment, and change of Japanese economy in response to the country's prolonged economic stagnation. Drawing on their scholarship, the article highlights the dual character of Japanese capitalism - the persistence of core elements of a coordinated market economy on the one hand, and the incremental revision of existing practices towards a liberal market model by state agencies and firms on the other hand. The case of Japan suggests that while coordinated market economies may face the danger of losing some of their comparative institutional advantages under rapid technological change and increased international competition, they may not make an unambiguous switch to liberal institutions, and may take a variety of reform paths in coping with internal and external pressures.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Organizational culture; constructivism; World Bank; norm entrepreneurs; balance of payments financing; institutions";
ID;"INTERNATIONAL-MONETARY-FUND; POLICY; IDEAS";
AB;The World Bank is delegated the authority to provide long-term stabilization and general purpose balance of payments loans, what the Bank once described as 'program loans'. Yet after a brief period in its early years, the Bank stopped disbursing these loans for an extended period. Why? This paper shows that changes to the Bank's early lending practices can be understood largely as a product of intra-organizational dynamics and change that facilitated the construction of a 'project-oriented culture' that delegitimized the disbursement of program loans. Though providing a number of compelling reasons to expect autonomous behavior from international organizations (IOs), such dynamics present a blind spot for rationalist approaches, which offer little insight into the processes that shape preference formation 'from within' IOs. The paper augments constructivist approaches by going beyond structuralist and static conceptions of IO staff as simply reacting to initiatives 'from above' or 'from below' and offering a more dynamic explanation of organizational change that describes how internal norm entrepreneurs emerge and proactively and strategically reconstruct an IO's culture. Emphasis is placed on the role of personnel and internal institutional configurations.;

AB;Since the end of the Cold War, the US has spearheaded the homogenization of the world economy along neoliberal lines. The US-led neoliberal international order, however, did not go unchallenged. Since the late 1980s, Japan has challenged the foundation of the neoliberal international order by asserting the role of the state in economic development. In the vein of constructivist scholarship with emphasis on the meaning-oriented discursive production of the world that has social effects, I ask the question of what made it possible for Japan to challenge neoliberalism. To answer this question, I examine the Japanese developmentalist discourse to uncover a historically constructed collective meaning that enabled the Japanese challenge to be conceivable as a justificatory foundation. I find a shared, intersubjective meaning called 'normalcy,' which the Japanese developmentalists have historically attached to the role of the state in economic development. Here 'normalcy' means that state-led economic development has been a normal practice for all the successful industrializers in the history of the world economy. In the eyes of the Japanese developmentalists, what is truly 'normal' or 'universal' is the proven validity of state-led economic development across time and space. I argue that this shared 'normalcy' meaning available in the Japanese developmentalist discourse creates the very possibility of the Japanese challenge.;

AB;The dominant player behind the Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement, as regards patents, was a handful of American pharmaceutical transnational corporations ('big pharma'). Given that TRIPs was exceptionally controversial, how was US big pharma uniquely enabled to command the entire trade diplomatic machinery of the US and, through that, enact global law in its favour? This paper explores one crucial factor in the enacting of TRIPs, namely the prior pursuit of domestic US patent reform, from which a highly integrated and powerful single-issue political coalition between US big pharma, the new biotechnology sector and academic life science departments was formed. This created the political context in the US in which patent issues, particularly those affecting the pharmaceuticals industry, came to be considered matters of state. But explaining both the success of this patent coalition and the subsequent success of the US-led international demands for TRIPs in turn demands appeal to analysis of the structure of the global economy and its transformation to one of neoliberal financialisation, from a watershed of 1980. The paper explores how the critical histories of each of the three sectors of the patent coalition are illuminated by analysis in the context of this structural change and the underlying connections between apparently disparate issues it reveals.;

ID;"GLOBALIZATION; POLITICS";
AB;Compared with the stated aims and the claims for urgent action, multilateral environmental agreements show unsatisfying results. Among other reasons - e.g. a deficit in national implementation - lack of coherence among a variety of overlapping and sometimes contradictory international institutions is considered as one major cause which needs to be overcome. In this article, however, it is argued that this lack of coherence is not a result of a lack of cooperation but a form of governance failure strongly connected with the political and economic structures of global capitalism and its ongoing neoliberal-imperial transformation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this governance failure is a by-product of the articulation of sometimes antagonistic interests and related power relations inscribed in different national and international institutions. Building on the concept of societal relationships with nature, on historical-materialist state theory and its perspective of the internationalization of the state as well as on the regulation approach, the paper analyzes the tension between different international institutions in order to understand the actual transformations towards a post-Fordist governance of nature. The empirical issues dealt with are different international regulations concerning the appropriation of genetic resources, especially the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO).;

DE;"Globalization; state-building; economic reform; governance; World Trade Organization; democratization";
AB;The Arab region finds itself at a historical cross-road between resilience and resistance to globalization. Arab countries' short-term strategies to globalization are primarily determined by the diversification of their respective economies. Long-term adjustments to globalization are mitigated by existing social and political structures. While Arab states might seem exceptional in many ways, they display common features that have their origins in their history of state-formation. The key challenge for Arab states is to widen state revenues to include taxes, tariffs and other income and to increase the state's capacity to prepare effectively for times of fiscal crisis. International policies must take the interest of incumbent elites into account when proposing economic adjustment programmes and turn from a technical understanding of governance towards a political.;

DE;"State-formation; rentier state; political economy; development; taxation; democratization";
ID;"DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PERSPECTIVE; WAR";
AB;This article argues that rentier states stand in contrast to states that have to rely on domestic resource extraction. They display a particular path to state-formation that by and large defies the European path of state-formation: natural resource dependence (mainly oil dependence) has created weak states that are autonomous from societal demands and that do not rely on domestic taxation. State-formation has not been accompanied by political accountability, transparency, or what Charles Tilly has termed the 'civilianisation of government'. In rentier states the expenditure side of public revenues is most clearly linked to a state-building agenda of creating societal peace and political acquiescence. On a theoretical level, this article offers a new reading of state-formation based on the form and the performance of the state. Focusing on a functional understanding of statehood, it thereby highlight where Arab states are strong (security function and in times of oil booms, welfare function) and where they are weak (representation function, and in times of fiscal crisis, welfare function).;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
DE;"Economic system; economic reform; development; patrimonial capitalism; Arab world; political economy";
ID;"DIRECT-INVESTMENT; INSTITUTIONS; POLITICS; POLICY";
AB;This contribution claims that structural economic reform, in a range of non-OECD countries, has led to capitalist, yet non-market economies which differ qualitatively from competition-based market systems. Patrimonial capitalism is an economic order that is shaped by the political order and power relations it enshrines, and is characterized by distinct features such as structurally higher transaction costs and a distinct relation between formal institutions and informal rules that govern exchange processes. It can flourish only in specific types of non-democratic political environments. While anecdotal evidence is presented from Arab cases, the concept's applicability is not restricted to any single world region. The findings are relevant for comparative economic systems analysis, but also for the practice of international cooperation because they can serve to better assess the political-economic context in which structural reform is supported, and to avoid errors that continue to be committed by international policy-makers in assisting economic reform processes worldwide. Conceptually, as is shown, neither neoclassical theory nor institutional economics provide adequate tools for assessing such questions on the economic orders level. This article therefore suggests a wider and integrated framework that also includes approaches established by political science and political and economic sociology.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Saudi Arabia; WTO negotiations; domestic societal coalitions; rentier state; two-level games; trade policy";
ID;"DOMESTIC POLITICS; TRADE-POLICY";
AB;Based on a case study of Saudi Arabia's WTO accession, the article offers a critique of conventional factor- and sector-based models of trade policy, proposing instead a two-level institutional account that is likely to be relevant for non-democratic states in general. Historically grown patterns of institutional fragmentation in both public and private sector in Saudi Arabia have made interest formation and the building of policy coalitions difficult. Various WTO-related economic reforms have therefore been held up as long as they were negotiated within the disjointed Saudi system. However, as soon as the Saudi leadership decided to directly follow the reform demands of its international negotiation partners, changes were rammed through rapidly - as institutional fragmentation of interests prevented an encompassing veto coalition against a comprehensive policy package which was in its substance imposed from outside. Fragmentation of state, business and relations between them can hence mean policy stalemate, but can also make for rapid policy adjustment under conditions of external pressure. In its conclusion, the article relates these findings to the institutionalist literature on trade in general.;

AB;"The notion of distinct national varieties or systems of capitalism gained considerable currency in the last two decades. This review essay highlights three theoretical premises which define what we call the comparative capitalisms (CC) approach to political economy: First, national economies are characterized by distinct institutional configurations; second, these configurations are a source of comparative institutional advantage; and third, the configurations are stabilized by institutional path dependence. Within these common premises, the CC literature contains a number of competing theories and we highlight the fundamental distinctions among them and draw out their respective limitations. We specifically examine the role of politics within the CC literature and how emerging conceptions of politics may contribute to understanding institutional change in capitalist systems.";

TI;The politics of influence: An analysis of IMF surveillance;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"IMF; surveillance; international standards; international monetary cooperation; peer pressure";
ID;GOVERNMENTS;
AB;IMF surveillance is typically thought to have effect because it provides useful information to member countries, because it engages countries in cooperative behaviour or because it piggy-backs the bargaining power the IMF enjoys in some countries. This article explores IMF surveillance by bringing to bear theoretical explanations as to why and how these effects might work. The simplest explanation is a rationalist-realist one that the IMF has impact in countries over whom it has bargaining power: this is borne out by the evidence regarding IMF surveillance in aid-dependent countries. However, this is not the only condition under which surveillance might work. Rationalist-institutionalists point to the role information plays in shaping competition and cooperation among states, and this effect is borne out to a limited degree by the impact of IMF-supported international standards and surveillance activities on the other economies. Finally, constructivists would describe the possible impact of surveillance in terms of learning or socialization, focusing on the social organization and impact of the IMF's activities. The evidence, however, suggests that neither bilateral nor multilateral surveillance is structured or organized in a way that promotes learning or socialization. The implications are that for IMF surveillance to be more effective across all its members would require restructuring the way the organization engages with its members, as well as a greater delegation of authority by countries to the organization.;

AB;Neoliberal market reformers stress the 'market building instincts' of private owners to justify rapid forms of property transformation under illiberal political conditions. Private owners demand the institutions of the self-restraining state to protect property from various forms of expropriation and to enforce contracts. Legacy theorists counter that under illiberal political conditions, economic insiders are more likely to capture the benefits of privatization programs and then seek exemption from the rule of law rather than application of it. We employ a 'path contingency' approach to show that under illiberal, competitive authoritarian conditions, privatization recipients and other private economic agents are unlikely to demand the basic institutions of market democracy. Yet, this is by no means a stable set of affairs. Political inequality and its attendant rent-seeking behavior will likely delay or distort growth and can contribute to economic and political instability. Political crisis may follow as regimes face societal frustration and energized, united political oppositions. Such crises are moments of uncertainty and flux. Crises provide private economic agents in particular with an opportunity to reconsider their ties to an illiberal regime. This paper examines these propositions during illiberal regime crises in Serbia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.;

DT;Article;
DE;"Law; legal pluralism; harmonization; power; private international law; secured transactions";
AB;In this paper, I explore two central characteristics of the mobilization of law in the global political economy - the role of legal pluralism and the importance of legal expertise. The interaction of these two factors goes a long way towards explaining the ways in which legal norms, actors, and institutions have been enrolled to construct and organize powerful actors in the global economy. In order to explore these dynamics, the article focuses on the area of private international law and analyzes the ongoing effort to harmonize the legal rules governing secured credit. This case study helps to highlight the connections between legal expertise and projects of political economic power, and to work out a fundamental dynamic generated by legal pluralism - the combination of continued conflicts between powerful actors in a context of shared understandings of the basic rules of the global economic system. I conclude by considering the obstacles presented by these dynamics for projects that aim at harnessing international economic law to the needs and interests of the weak.;

AB;In an effort to protect a rapidly eroding international payments accounts balance, American policy makers pursued a capital controls program through much of the 1960s, contrary to the interests of private finance. How can we explain this outcome when, through much of the postwar period, private finance appears to have been well served by the state's foreign and domestic economic policy? This paper argues that, in responding to international pressure to bring its international payments account into balance, American state elites pursued a conservative Keynesian growth agenda that reconfigured the relationship between the American executive and central bank, which dramatically increased the state's autonomy from the influence of private financial interests. This paper therefore takes up the question of state autonomy and offers a new interpretation of the transition to neoliberal global financial structures from the Bretton Woods system of international monetary relations.;

AB;Wage restraint has been the paradigm in the much discussed Dutch political economy - just as labor market liberalization is the paradigm in the internationally dominant politico-economic policy discourse. The Dutch employment 'miracle' has been associated with the protracted wage restraint capital and labor agreed upon in 1982 to improve competitiveness, profits and investment. Competitiveness and investment have not improved since then, however. Nonetheless, the paradigm is remarkably stable. It is sustained by a broad epistemic community of politicians, academics, journalists, civil servants and at its heart the Central Planning Bureau (CPB), a government advisory agency that since the 1950s has been the intellectual center of Dutch socio-economic policy making. Partially based on interviews we analyze the paradigmatic character of the wage restraint formula, the epistemic community sustaining it and the pivotal position of the CPB within this community. Looking for the basis of its stability we think that accidental circumstances, the esteem of the CPB, imitation, conformism and idleness are explanatory factors, which appear to be as relevant as and perhaps even more relevant than rational convictions, and which could also shed some light on the dominance of liberal reform paradigms or other cases of ideational dominance.;

TI;The political economy of sectoral exchange rate preferences and lobbying: Germany from 1960-2008, and beyond;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Exchange rates; Germany; globalization; lobbying; microfoundations; preferences";
AB;Do the observable preferences and behavior of economic actors correspond to microeconomic models? I address this question by examining the microfoundations of firms' exchange rate preferences and lobbying activity between 1960 and 2008 in Germany, one of the most internationally exposed and export-oriented economies. The phenomena to be explained are twofold. First, lobbying activity appears to have declined over time. Archival sources provide evidence of strong preference articulation and exchange rate lobbying during the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, by contrast, the intensity of firms' lobbying activity has gone down, despite greater exchange rate fluctuations and currency appreciations, which are costly and potentially ruinous for producers of tradable goods. Second, there is substantial variation in the propensity of tradables producers to lobby over exchange rate levels. I argue that the extent of firms' internationalization is key for explaining both of these observations and the political economy of exchange rate preferences and lobbying more generally. Firms and sectors with a low degree of 'operational hedging' or diversification across different currency areas are much more likely to have preferences for a low exchange rate and to lobby over exchange rate levels than their more diversified counterparts. As globalization proceeds apace, we may be moving towards a world in which 'no preference' is the stable equilibrium.;

AB;Eight years after the launch of its third stage, and on the brink of its expansion, the European Union's (EU) Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has proven to be successful. However, EMU has also highlighted the diversity of its members economic performance, and their need to run larger public deficits than they initially committed to. This special issue attempts to find out what can be done to relieve the tensions in EMU. The source of EMU's difficulty seems to lie in its weak legitimacy, ambiguous gevernance, and asymmetric institutional design. The EU needs to improve its fiscal rules and streamline decision making in the European Central Bank without eroding legitimacy.;

AB;"How will enlargement of the European Union (EU) affect prospects for the euro as an international currency? Previously I have argued that Europe's joint currency is fated to remain a distant second to America's greenback long into the foreseeable future because of three structural factors - relatively high transactions costs, due to inefficiencies in Europe's financial markets; a serious anti-growth bias built into the institutions of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU); and, most importantly, ambiguities at the heart of the monetary union's governance structure. In this essay I extend my earlier analysis, focusing in particular on the impact of enlargement on the governance structure of EMU. From the start, internationalization of the euro has been retarded by a lack of clarity about the delegation of monetary authority among governments and EU institutions. The addition of a diverse collection of new members, with significantly different interests and priorities, can only make the challenge of governance worse, exacerbating ambiguity at the expense of transparency and accountability. Enlargement will diminish, not expand, the euro's attractiveness as a rival to the greenback.";

AB;"This article examines the consequences of the political 'incompleteness' of the monetary union for the democratic accountability of its external monetary policy, comparing the euro area to the United States. In most countries, exchange-rate policymaking is substantially delegated to the finance ministry and central bank oversight by other domestic actors is relatively weak. While this is true of the United States, the role of the Congress provides the possibility for 'democratic override' when policy diverges substantially from the preferences of a broad set of private sector interests. Europe's monetary union, by contrast, lacks such a mechanism; no institution can provide an effective check on the policies pursued by the core actors, the ECB and Eurogroup. A comparison of the postures of the United States and euro area toward Chinese exchange rate policy suggests that these institutional differences affect policy outcomes.";

AB;Political economists have raised concerns that EMU's asymmetric institutional design leaves the project's legitimacy vulnerable to fluctuations in the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the euro. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that overall support for EMU within the euro area remained high over the period 1999-2005, thus allaying concerns over the project's legitimacy. At the same time, public attitudes towards EMU did vary from one euro-area member to another with perceived rather than actual economic performance appearing to be an important factor behind this cross-country variation. In policy terms, these findings underline the need for a system of euro-area economic governance that promotes a high degree of support for the single currency over the long-term. This will necessitate a more effective approach to output legitimation as well as policies that seek legitimacy for EMU by emphasising process, values and inputs.;

DT;Article;
DE;"ECB; EMU; central banking; enlargement; efficiency; legitimacy";
ID;POLICY;
AB;This article analyses the December 2002 reform of decision making in the European Central Bank's (ECB) Governing Council in terms of national economy size reflected in the bargaining power of the ECB Governing Council members and member state macroeconomic interest. The National Central Bank (NCB) governors of the largest member states were concerned about the impact upon ECB monetary policy making of equal representation being extended to future member states. By eliminating equal voting rights, the reform distorts the meaning of equality, representativeness and ad personam participation as guiding principles of ECB decision making, moving from equal member state representation towards an emphasis placed upon Eurozone economy representation. At the same time, two possible concerns watered down efforts to modify 'representativeness' and prevent enlargement contributing to inefficiency in Governing Council decision making. First, the current smaller member state NCB governors opposed a significant reduction of their 'voice' in ECB monetary policy making. Second, legitimacy concerns ensured persistent support for the maintenance of a large and 'decentralised' Governing Council.;

The American experience with similar macrobudgetary rules suggests that deficit targets may actually act as an incentive for political leaders to engage in noncompliant behavior. If targets were revised to budgetary objectives that politicians could achieve more easily and claim credit for accomplishing, compliance with the new macrobudgetary rules might be increased.;

The conventional view holds that there are multiple political and economic barriers to British entry into monetary union-large fractions of public opinion, business leaders, and the Conservative party oppose entry; Britain's economic cycle is not synchronized with that of the euro-zone; adoption of the single currency would harm foreign trade and investment; British political institutions make it difficult to muster support for such a move, and so on. I argue that policy failure is a more important influence on British economic policy. Major changes occur when extant policy fails and there exists an alternative policy idea that both explains this failure persuasively and prescribes a new and more effective way forward. A British government might advocate euro membership if the current framework for policy in Britain-central bank independence with a floating exchange rate-fails, and policies pursued by the European Central Bank address the source of this failure. This combination would also lead many politicians, business leaders, and voters to see the advantages of euro membership.";

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"efficiency; equity; distribution; justice; reparations; rights";
AB;The paper offers a three-fold typology for comparing and assessing arguments about the political economy of international distributive justice. Economists use aggregative criteria, specifying economic fairness as a subset of efficient allocations. The political philosopher suggests moral side constraints to place on distributions, a category that encompasses much recent scholarship, including the Rawls-Nozick debate. The third approach addresses the deservingness of different claimants to resources and issues of fair compensation, often in the context of specifying legal rules. Though these traditions are not uniquely international in focus, it is that aspect that is addressed here, both with respect to theoretical relevance to international affairs and practical applications to international redistribution, including specific arguments such as aid to poor countries and reparations for damages. The attractiveness of each group of arguments depends on the issue at hand and the goals of the proponent. Each offers independent but not mutually exclusive principles that might provide the basis for an integrated approach to international distributive justice.;

AB;Svensson (1998, Kyklos 51(2): 259-75) asked whether strategic trade theory or aspects of sectors' political influence accounted for OECD governments' research and development funding, but he did not consider the roles of military spending or electoral politics. We examine US government research and development (R&D) expenditures during 1958-1998 to assess all these perspectives. Because expenditures were often undisclosed, disclosure itself must also be modeled. Disclosure and reported spending levels are affected by the same considerations that affect funding for other programs. While some variables invoked by strategic trade theory or models of arms races have their expected relation to reported funding, the marginal effects of employment, political concentration, and electoral votes are far larger. For the US it thus appears that the role of strategic trade policy or military security in government R&D expenditure patterns is relatively modest. Its government R&D funding is largely a matter of politics as usual.;

TI;The politics of 'democratization': Lessons from Bosnia and Iraq;

ID;"STATE COLLAPSE; CIVIL-SOCIETY; RECONSTRUCTION; WAR; HERZEGOVINA; GOVERNANCE; NGOS";
AB;Since the end of the Cold War, the suspension of state sovereignty as a means of encouraging democracy has become a common policy instrument for hegemonic state actors. Deploying discourses of democratization, such interventions have promoted a singular narrative of state building, combining neo-liberal economic norms with a vocabulary of democratic participation. Drawing on the central comparison- between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iraq, this paper argues that such technical narrations of intervention depoliticize both the planning and execution of democratization initiatives. This argument is made at two levels of analysis. At the policy level, the geopolitical contexts of intervention in Bosnia and Iraq are used to illustrate the normative nature of declarations of state competence. At the agency level, I examine processes of democratic reconstruction following conflict. In the cases of both Bosnia and Iraq, international administrations have equated the development of civil society with 'democratization.' Using detailed empirical evidence from Brcko District, Bosnia, the paper explores how these surrogate state agencies have used legal instruments to shape the conduct and institutions of civil society. Consequently, the examples of Bosnia and Iraq highlight the fraught moral and political questions prompted by contemporary practices of state building.;

AB;According to liberal arguments for American hegemony a dangerous world needs American power. How does the liberal view hold up against the reality test of how political aims are interpreted and implemented by security professionals? I argue that many security operations are embedded in strategies of political brinkmanship. The second part explores whether American economic policies too can be viewed as brinkmanship. This concerns the ramifications of 'free market' policies for the United States at a time when exports become imports, the trade deficit deepens, income inequality widens and external deficits rise to unsustainable levels. In closing I reflect on the rationality of political and economic brinkmanship.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;

DE;"millennium challenge account; poverty; security; neo-liberalism; empire";
ID;"AMERICAN EMPIRE; STATES; AID";
AB;March 2002 George W Bush announced that the new Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) would increase US development assistance by $5 billion per annum. The MCA's goal of 'reducing poverty through growth' was highlighted in the November 2002 National Security Strategy, which elevated development to join defence and diplomacy as one of the three pillars of the 'war on terror'. This paper critiques the crude and dogmatic alignments that the NSS and the MCA draw between neoliberal economic policies, poverty reduction and security. Drawing on an analysis of the first five MCA 'Compacts' with Cape Verde, Honduras, Madagascar, Nicaragua and Georgia, I argue that the newly invigorated security-development paradigm is being used to legitimate more spending on 'development' programmes which are primarily intended to serve the interests of US consumers, manufacturers and investors. Despite the rhetoric, poverty reduction is at best a secondary objective. The paradox of American empire is that its pursuit of economic hegemony through the extension and ever-deepening penetration of neoliberal capitalism (in which the MCA is one small vehicle) precisely undermines the conditions for sustainable profitability, as well as social justice. This analysis suggests that like its military and diplomatic counterparts, the developmental 'pillar' of national security will contribute to the erosion of human and political security for the United States and the rest of the world.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS; HEALTH; GENDER; AIDS; WAR";
AB;One of the more striking features of international responses to HIV/AIDS has been the framing of the pandernic in terms of security. But while a growing literature attempts to establish and explain putative linkages between HfV/AIDS and security, little work has addressed HIV/AIDS-security discourse with critical reflexivity or applied such an approach to particular cases. This article makes contributions in both these areas, locating discussion in the context of post-Cold War and post-9 / 11 shifts in geopolitics and biopolitics. It argues that while analyses employing securitization theory and biopolitics have advanced critical understanding of HIV/ AIDS and security, a more historicized approach and greater attention to geopolitics and gender are required. The article then reviews increasing US strategic interest in Africa and considers the emergence of particular formations of geopolitics and biopolitics around HIV/AIDS and security in the relationship between the US and Nigeria, drawing particular attention to the role of US-based think tanks. It shows how US strategic discourse has targeted the Nigerian state not just as a partner in energy security and counter-terrorism, but also as a key locale in the 'next wave' of HIV / AIDS. The article describes HIV / AIDS interventions that the US is supporting in Nigeria, identifies connections between HIV/AlDS relief and questions of security and gender, and considers some implications of the convergence of multiple security logics on Nigeria. The article concludes with reference to the political sociology of HIV/ AIDS relief and the era of formal colonialism.;

DE;"institutions; transitions; banks; regulation; development; policymaking";
ID;"ECONOMY; FIRM";
AB;Over the past 10-15 years the debate about the creation of economic governance institutions has shifted from an emphasis on the state rapidly implanting optimal incentives to a state capable of acting strategically and regulating. But how a government with little prior relevant skills or resources actually achieves the latter is still unclear. This article examines how different political approaches to transformation shape the creation of new institutional capabilities by analyzing bank sector reforms in the 1990s in three leading postcommunist democracies-Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Politicians create different political strategies that shape the organization of policymaking power, which, in turn, can facilitate or hinder the ability of relevant public and private actors to experiment and learn their new roles. With its emphasis on insulating power and rapidly implementing self-enforcing economic incentives, the 'depoliticization' approach creates few changes in bank behavior and, indeed impedes investment in new capabilities at the bank and supervisory levels. With its emphasis on distributed authority and rules of information sharing, the 'participatory restructuring' approach appears to have fostered innovative, cost-effective monitoring structures for recapitalization, a strong supervisory system, and a stable, expanding banking sector.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"central bank independence; institutional change; expert power; inter-state dominance; Israeli political-economy; liberalizing reforms";
ID;"STABILIZATION PROGRAM; COUNTRIES; STATE";
AB;Over the last two decades, increasing numbers of central banks in both developed and developing countries have gained independence from political echelons and other state bureaucracies, becoming important actors in the political arena with the capacity to significantly affect the configuration and functioning of national economies. Through a detailed process-tracing analysis, this paper studies the institutional turning point in the position of the Israeli central bank within the state institutional configuration: namely, the amendment of the Bank of Israel Law in 1985 which prohibits the central bank from providing loans to the government to finance budgetary deficits. The analysis focuses on the conditions that facilitated the institutional change, as well as on the actors and mechanisms that were involved in the process. This legislative amendment, which opened the path to the increasing independence of the Bank of Israel, was the result of the constitution of a new cross-national field of policy-making, comprised of both local and foreign political actors: the Israeli Ministry of Finance, the US government and a cross-national network of Israeli and American academic economists. Mechanisms of both inter-state dominance and expert power operated and interacted with each other within this field, producing synergetic effects that fostered the dynamic that led to central bank independence.;

DT;Article;
DE;"financial crises; market opening; foreign investment; US foreign economic policy; multinational corporations; Korea; Thailand";
ID;GLOBALIZATION;
AB;Foreign commercial and economic behaviour in emerging markets continues to be a contentious issue. This article reconsiders the claim that US actors leverage their influence at times of economic crisis to pry open developing markets to American business ownership. On the basis of a number of theoretical propositions and evidence from Korea and Thailand, the article argues that American government agencies and firms took several different directions after the Asian financial crisis, rather than exhibiting a coherent response. On the one hand, assertive US actions were taken to facilitate market opening in Korea and Thailand but on the other hand, US companies placed relatively little foreign investment in these countries. The interests of US actors are disaggregated in the article to demonstrate the importance of an autonomous Treasury Department and the separate but no less important activities of corporate restructuring specialists, such as investment banks. The outcome of the Asian crisis at the firm level is linked to new trends in US foreign investment, namely the rise of outsourcing and private equity funds, as well as the concentration of US ownership in services and science-based sectors. The article downplays the significance of European acquisitions in Asia concluding instead that the Asian crisis, in fact, re-affirmed specific strengths of US capital.;

DE;"globalization; hegemonic discourse; models of capitalism; domestic structures; Greece; Ireland";
ID;"EUROPEAN INTEGRATION; STATE";
AB;This paper attempts to make a contribution to the study and understanding of the phenomenon of globalization and its interplay with national politico-economic systems. How did globalization resonate and/or dominate in different national contexts? What was the role of national political economies and domestic institutions in this process? What role did specific institutional actors played in it? Focusing on the materialization of globalization discourse in Greece and Ireland, the paper presents three main findings: (i) the reproduction of the Greek and Irish politico-economic systems during the 1990s was dominated, to a significant extent, by the same set of meanings and practices, (ii) the way in which this set of meanings and practices emerged in the two countries was fundamentally different: in Greece it defined a new zone of contestation, whereas in Ireland it defined a new zone of fundamental consensus, (iii) after the end of the 1990s, these two different facets of hegemonic globalization seemed to converge. The paper draws on these findings to examine the role of political economy and domestic institutions in the communication of the hegemonic discourse of globalization.;

AB;This article examines how organized labor has responded to and sought to influence privatization of the public sector. In order to explain the variation in labor organizations' influence on the process of privatization design and implementation it examines the interaction between reforming governments and organized labor in Poland, Egypt, Mexico and the Czech Republic. The article argues that we can more fully account for organized labor's influence on economic restructuring policies by considering the historical legacies of state-labor interaction. Those interactions affect the resources available to labor, such as legal prerogatives, financial autonomy and experience. These resources in turn affect the relative power between organized labor and the reforming government and thus influence the ability of organized labor to shape privatization policies.;

DE;"intellectual property rights; commodification; history of intellectual property; markets";
ID;"LAW; HISTORY";
AB;Although often now presented as a potentially universal set of legal principles, the particular history of the initial development of intellectual property rights (IPRs), first in Venice, then subsequently in Britain and across Europe is directly related to Europe's specific history. In this paper, I argue that we cannot separate the development of intellectual property as a legal form from the specific early history of capitalism in Europe. The technological, institutional and political philosophical developments that underlay the development of nascent IPRs were a specific historical conjunction and suggests that rather than a universal set of rights, IPRs must be set in their historical, political economic context. In conclusion I draw some links between questions of differential treatment under contemporary multilateral governance through the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement and this early history of intellectual property to criticise the claims for a universal set of institutionalised rights without regard to levels of economic development.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"intellectual property rights; information; trade; globalization";
ID;"UNITED-STATES; INDUSTRY";
AB;Strange argued that barriers to trade have fallen because increasing returns in product development and production: rising R&D costs, short product life cycles and low marginal costs of production raise the relative cost of producing for protected national markets. As an explanation for global ( as opposed to regional) liberalization, Strange's argument requires that increasing returns be extreme. The class of products exhibiting the most extreme increasing returns is that of information products-goods such as general purpose computer software and digitized entertainment. Following Strange's reasoning, it might seem that the technological nature of information products is one of the drivers of global trade liberalization.;
;The trouble with this argument is that while the technological properties of information products are necessary for extreme increasing returns, they are not sufficient. Increasing returns in information products are cemented by business models which leverage small portfolios of intellectual property into the control of markets. Information products are, however, equally well suited to other business models in which increasing returns are slight and competitors are many. To continue with the software and entertainment examples earlier, these include models based on free software, and on disintermediated markets for digitized entertainment. At present, the institutional structures within which information products are made and sold, are contested. The outcome of these contests could result either in the maintenance of monopoly power and increasing returns, or a shift to far more competitive and decentralized market structures. If the latter occurs, the increasing returns imperative for global trade liberalization would be weakened.;

ID;"DOMESTIC POLITICS; GLOBALIZATION; STATE";
AB;This paper examines China's industrial and trade policy dynamics in the post-WTO context. It does so by addressing the domestic bias of the extant literature on China's economic opening, instead offering an approach which explores the complex interaction between external pressures and domestic conflicts and choices that have shaped China's economic integration. Specifically, we examine a recent failed attempt of the Chinese authorities at establishing a go-it-alone mercantilist policy relating to IT infrastructure in the wake of internal divisions and strong foreign opposition. We argue in this case that the clash between the pro-open and nationalist/mercantilist forces shaped the policymaking process, whilst the international factors underpinned the direction of policy change by tipping the power balance towards the liberal reformers through China's unique institutional arrangements.;

TI;Has China abandoned self-reliance?;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Chinese economic nationalism; self-reliance; technological renewal";
ID;GROWTH;
AB;China is commonly seen as having abandoned the national route to development in favour of one centred on global integration. Zili gengsheng conventionally translated as self-reliance-is viewed now as a historical term relevant only to the Maoist years. Instead China's increasing economic interdependence with the global economy is held to imply that China's capacity to retain the initiative for its own development is receding: China is being 'internationalised'. This paper questions this assumption in three ways. It argues that there has been a greater degree of continuity in China's development strategy between the 'revolutionary' and 'reform' eras than is commonly recognized, and that in particular China has not yet made a significant shift from growth driven by factor accumulation to growth driven by technological renewal. Secondly, it suggests that China's capacity to use global integration to engineer technological convergence is constrained by the nature of global production systems, WTO intellectual property regulations, and the strategic perceptions of the lead economies to China's rise. Lastly, it argues that, if China's drive for technological renewal, evident since the 1990s, is not automatically correlated to either internal or external structural change, then it is best explained by calculations that are strategic and nationalist, rather than pragmatic and internationalist. In this way, if technological convergence is understood as the factor which binds national to international and economic to political, interdependence does not relieve China of the responsibility to develop by its own efforts but arguably enhances this.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"property rights; patents; pharmaceuticals; TRIPs; India; Turkey";
ID;INDUSTRY;
AB;The last two decades saw sweeping changes in the pharmaceutical patent policies of the developing countries from weak/non patentability to strong patent regimes. Analysing the policy change from a political economy approach, this paper pursues two simultaneous objectives. Firstly, it explores the common factors underlying the recent changes in the pharmaceutical patent policies of the developing countries. Secondly, it analyses the sources of the differential policy outcomes on pharmaceutical patents in India and Turkey.;
;Against the state-centric theories that interpret the policy change primarily as a matter between the nation states from developed and developing countries, the paper presents two arguments. Firstly, it argues that the increased structural power of the transnational capital has been the common factor underlying the recent changes in the pharmaceutical patent policies of the developing countries. Secondly, it argues that the nature, scope, and outcomes policy processes on pharmaceutical patents have been shaped by the dynamics of the inter class struggles across the developing world. The paper supports this latter argument through a focussed comparative historical analysis of the public policy processes and outcomes on pharmaceutical patents in Turkey and India.;

ID;"LATIN-AMERICA; LAND-REFORM; EAST-ASIA; PEASANT; FUTURE; STATE; CONVERSION; MOVEMENT; THAILAND; GROWTH";
AB;The 'free market', export-led development strategy has not delivered its promise of development in agriculture, as far as the Philippines is concerned. The World Bank- and IMF-instigated privatization and deregulation policies with direct consequence to rural livelihoods carried out much earlier and far wider in the Philippines than in some other Southeast Asian countries have coincided, overlapped and interlinked with the GATT/WTOtrade/exchange rules. These two broad sets of policy related to agricultural production and exchange, combined, have largely reinforced, not undermined or eroded, pre-existing agrarian structures dominated by domestic and transnational elites. The overall outcome is the opposite of neoliberal reformers' predictions: the transformation of the Philippines from a net agricultural exporting to a net agricultural importing country. This development strategy has failed to address the persistence of poverty and growing inequality in this country. If a poverty-eradicating strategic national development is to be achieved in the Philippines and in some of the latter's regional neighbors, a radical recasting of the pre-existing agrarian structures partly through explicitly pro-poor land policies will be necessary and urgent.;

TI;The democratization of finance? Promises, outcomes and conditions;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"financialization; financial literacy; democratization of finance; cultural economy";
ID;WEALTH;
AB;This paper analyses the 'democratization of finance' or the promise that all households can make money and/or manage risk by buying appropriate financial services products. It does so by exploring the reasons for discrepancy between what is promised and what can be delivered. Our analysis starts from the economic promises and political pitches for the democratization of finance since the early 1990s and the corollary emphasis on promoting mass financial literacy. The article then identifies three key social preconditions which must be satisfied before the promise is delivered. Evidence and argument from the UK and US suggests that these conditions are not met because the context is confusing, individuals lack calculative competence and products are opaque. Under these conditions felicitous outcomes are uncertain for existing middle class savers and very unlikely for lower income groups. A concluding section relates this analysis to the cultural economy literature and to the politics of social security versus individual responsibility.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL-MONETARY-FUND; NEW-ZEALAND; GOVERNANCE; AUSTRALIA; POLICY; COUNTRIES; IDEAS";
AB;The International Monetary Fund spends most of its time monitoring its member states' economic performance and advising on institutional change. While much of the literature sees the Fund as a policy enforcer in 'emerging market' and 'frontier' economies, little attention has been paid to exploring the Fund's bilateral surveillance of its Western member states. This article proposes that 'seeing like the IMF' provides a dynamic view of how the Fund frames its advice for institutional change. It does so through 'associational templates' that do not blindly promote institutional convergence, but appeal for change on the basis of like-characteristics among economies. Many Western states, particularly small open economies, consider the Fund's advice as important not only for technical know-how, but because Fund assessments are significant to international and domestic political audiences. This article traces the Fund's advice on taxation and monetary reform to two coordinated market economies, Denmark and Sweden, and two liberal market economies, Australia and New Zealand, from 1975 to 2004. It maps how the Fund advocated 'policy revolutions' and 'policy recombinations' during this period, advice that coincided with important institutional changes within these small open economies.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"currency liberalisation; monetary regimes; Norway; domestic adjustment; European payments union; Bretton Woods";
AB;In the 1950s, Norway was among those countries most reluctant to embrace the ongoing process of currency and trade liberalisation. Both trade liberalisation, the establishment of the European Payments Union (EPU) and the plans for the reintroduction of currency convertibility were met with ambiguity. This ambiguity contrasts both the general image of Norway's traditional liberal foreign economic policy and the expected approach of a small open economy. This article argues that the origins of ambiguity were deeply rooted in the political economy of post-war Norway, and a result of the meeting between grand domestic ambitions, external constraints derived from this set of ambitions and, importantly, the set of prevailing economic beliefs that influenced both domestic policy and international orientation.;

DE;"regionalism; monetary politics; trade politics; Central America; West Africa; historical institutionalism";
ID;"OPTIMUM CURRENCY AREAS; FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE-RATES; INTEGRATION; POLICY; POLITICS";
AB;Conventional theories in political economy argue that monetary cooperation is more likely in regions with trade interdependence. In practice, however, regional trade cooperation usually does not lead to monetary cooperation. I argue that this disparity results from different political economy logics in the two issue areas. In contrast to trade cooperation, the domestic actor that sacrifices the most in a regional monetary agreement is the government itself, which loses a significant tool for domestic economic adjustment as well as an important political symbol. Thus, monetary cooperation is only likely if there are direct benefits to the government to compensate for its lost monetary control. Benefits to the aggregate economy or to particular economic sectors are usually insufficient compensation. Experience with earlier monetary institutions, however, can in some cases reduce the costs to governments enough to make cooperation feasible.;
;I explore these arguments with two sets of case studies: Central America and West Africa. Central America has had the highest level of trade cooperation in the developing world, but never successfully implemented monetary cooperation. West Africa, by contrast, developed a strong regional currency despite its very low intra-regional trade. West Africa did have, however, experience with prior regional monetary institutions that lowered the costs of new cooperation for newly independent African governments.;

AB;The history of US trade policy from the 1930s to the present shows that an adequate analysis of policy outcomes necessitates the inclusion of both domestic and international factors. The analysis also requires an exploration of the conditions shaping the relative explanatory significance of domestic and international factors, and of how this relative significance changes over time. Drawing on historical institutionalist analysis, and applying it to a field of action that encompasses both political levels, I argue that institutions account for the historically specific balance between domestic and international factors. By altering the political influence of actors in and across the two dimensions, institutional arrangements determine whether domestic or international factors are prioritized. The image of a Great Divide between two distinct fields is hence replaced with an image of a fluid divide between different levels of a unified field of action.;

TI;Sovereignty and international labor migration: The 'security mentality' in Spanish-Moroccan relations as an assertion of sovereignty;

DE;"labor migration; security; sovereignty; Morocco; Spain";
ID;"STATE SOVEREIGNTY; POWER-POLITICS; GLOBALIZATION; WORLD; CONSTRUCTION; IMMIGRATION; RETHINKING; ECONOMY; AMERICA; ANARCHY";
AB;The increasing injection of security imperatives into migration policy has presented countries with a new form of sovereignty assertion. In this regard, the politics of 'securitization' provides a useful theoretical bridge across two literatures - one focusing on the character of sovereignty and the other devoted to understanding international labor migration, more often situated in the international political economy subfield. Approaching migration politics with a 'security mentality' is part of an effort by policymakers and citizens to respond to dynamics that are perceived to threaten a country's sovereign status and societal security. Whether it has served to truly enhance border control and deepen sovereignty claims is a matter of sharp debate, but the symbolic politics associated with the injection of security has gone far to enhance sovereignty claims and justify border control. The case of the Moroccan - Spanish 'migration system' illustrates the manner in which post Franco Spain has used migration politics to assert sovereignty claims vis-a-vis Morocco, deepen the country's sense of societal security, and affirm its status as a full member of the European space.;

TI;Refashioning IPE: What and how gender analysis teaches international (global) political economy;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"gender; economy; international; global; mainstream; critical";
AB;"It remains the case that, in spite of the consistently high quality and quantity of gender analysis, gender has not been able to achieve more than a marginal status in International Political Economy (IPE). Increasingly visible as a category of analysis, gender remains trivialized in the minds of both the mainstream and more critical IPE approaches, as a category pertaining only to the lives of women, women's labour rights and women's social movements. This essay therefore analyses what mainstream and critical IPE approaches do and do not say about the constitution of the global political economy. My central argument is that a gender(ed) IPE analysis is absolutely central to fully understanding and explaining the processes and practices of the global political economy, but that the dominant studies and practices of IPE tend not to take into account the contributions of gender based analyses. A critique of the detailed content of gender approaches in IPE is, however, not the main purpose of this review; rather, gender and feminist analyses are the lenses with which to view IPE, with its exclusions, silences and marginalisations, as well as its openings and future paths, not the other way around.";

DE;"trade strategy; United States; government procurement; Buy America Act; state activism; government-business cooperation";
ID;"PROTECTIONISM; POLITICS; POLICY";
AB;For all its importance as a policy tool around the globe, the study of public procurement has barely begun. The role of government purchasing in trade strategy, in particular, has been virtually ignored in the international political economy literature. We argue that government procurement increasingly serves as a weapon in the US arsenal of tools for sponsoring national champions, for securing the domestic front against foreign competitors, and for promoting exports via the penetration of foreign procurement markets. Whilst vigorously pressing for enlargement of procurement markets, the US is distinctive in having the most aggressive 'buy national' programs, which are enshrined in law and enforced in both formal and informal ways. Also at odds with its own liberal dictates, government procurement in the US involves a considerable amount of proactive state involvement and government-business cooperation.;

ID;"GLOBALIZATION; FEDERALISM; SCALE; STATE";
AB;This article examines and theorizes neoliberal ideas related to the scale aspects of multilevel governance. It argues that neoliberalism contains a self-conscious normative project for multilevel governance which is consistent across the federal, regional and global levels. It further argues that the underlying logic of this project can be usefully theorized through various critical understandings of the separation of the economic and the political in neoliberalism and, in particular, through Stephen Gill's concept of new constitutionalism. To demonstrate these points, the article draws on the normative work of neoliberal organic intellectuals-including Hayek, Friedman, Buchanan and various neoliberal think tanks-on 'market-preserving federalism' and the more recent extrapolation of these ideas to the regional and global levels.;

TI;Towards a conceptual framework for regionalisation: Bridging 'new regionalism' and 'integration theory';
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"new regionalism; integration theory; regionalisation";
AB;This paper argues that the divide between 'new' and 'old' regionalisms in international politics is increasingly seen as exaggerated, but that the conceptual implications of this non-difference have yet to be taken seriously. The attempt to build a new body of theory to explain and describe recent forms of region-building-the 'New Regionalist Approach'-is mistaken, and falsely sets up classical integration theory as an Other in an act of auto-definition. Likewise, the acceptance of this divide by EU scholars-whether explicitly or by default-hampers their own attempts to elaborate useful theory. The two areas of study are properly understood not as separate paradigms, but rather as sub-divisions of the same one. Thus, a fruitful way to harness the insights of scholars in both sub-fields of study is to undertake an explicit programme of comparative research based around an agreed set of independent variables, research issues and hypotheses, all stemming from a common definition of the dependent variable. The paper sets out a definition and typology of this dependent variable-'regionalisation'-and argues for a reflexive approach to the elaboration of a conceptual framework for its study. The paper finishes with a discussion of suitable independent variables and four tentative hypotheses to be explored in empirical research.;

DE;"taxation; Latin America; economic reform; supply-side economics; Debt Crisis";
ID;"POLICY; LIBERALIZATION; REVENUE";
AB;Throughout the past 20 years, Latin American countries have undertaken a battery of reforms to create simpler, more efficient tax systems with a greater emphasis on indirect taxes of broader bases, and more moderate marginal tax rates. This article aims to elucidate the amalgam of domestic and international forces that have fostered the reform of tax systems throughout Latin America. Domestic pressures stemmed from the debt crisis, the accompanying fiscal crisis of the state and the vital need to restore a measure of governance. International pressures emanated from the conditionality packages imposed by the International Monetary Fund, new intellectual winds in the field of economics, and economic globalization.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Mercosur; prolonged impasse; external agenda; internal agenda; regionalism; polarizing globalization; class struggle; reconfiguration thesis";
ID;"POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CONE; GOVERNANCE; BRAZIL";
AB;The article examines the linkages between Mercosur's search for a new agenda and its ambitious external agenda. It argues that mainstream IR theories are of little help to predict the future of Mercosur, and that the bloc's prospects for survival depend on the potential of class struggle at the domestic level to 'turn the tables' against neoliberal globalization, opening up the possibility of an autonomous South American strategy for development. Using a neo-Gramscian approach, the article criticizes both the excessive optimism of those who argue that a 'reconfigured' Mercosur will be able to endure in the brave new world of globalization and the excessive pessimism of those who argue that Mercosur is just an aspect of neoliberal globalization that only serves to incorporate more thoroughly the Southern Cone countries in the world capitalist system. Without internal consolidation and the strengthening of subregional institutions the external agenda cannot indefinitely guarantee Mercosur's survival, and is no substitute for facing head on the fundamental problems of the internal agenda, the only way of truly 'relaunching' Mercosur. In the absence of a serious commitment to do so, external negotiations, and the addition of more associate members may dilute the bloc as a customs union, forcing it to abandon the project of creating an EU-Iike common market.;

National Accounts data are shown to be indispensable for economic governance, yet, it is argued, they can also be misused in this context when spurious conclusions about economic policy are drawn from spurious differences in growth performance. That the US economy grows faster than most European economies since the mid-1990s is widely accepted as a stylized fact; and this had a strong impact on policy reform debates in Europe over the last decade. The paper questions the legitimacy of this debate by calculating the proportion of the US lead in growth over the European Union that can be explained simply in terms of differing statistical methods.";

ID;"CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; NEOLIBERALISM";
AB;On 1 January 2005, all stock exchange listed companies in the European Union (EU) began using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) written by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This article argues that the IASB's introduction of fair value accounting reflects and reinforces changed relations of production in which the financial sector increasingly dominates the productive sector, nationally institutionalized economic systems are undermined, and new forms of economic appropriation are validated. As a private body, the IASB has been able to rapidly introduce the fair value paradigm with little public debate outside specialized financial circles. In contrast to more functionalist views, this article argues that accounting standards are inherently political. Accounting numbers provide some of the key economic anchors around which social relations are structured. Accounting techniques cannot be reduced to questions of efficiency since they set out to quantify and compare things which, by their very nature, are neither quantifiable nor directly comparable.;

DE;"globalization; public opinion; culture; trade";
ID;"SUPPORT; COUNTRIES; INTERESTS; REFORM";
AB;Empirical studies of public opinion regarding globalization have to date addressed only economic integration. By way of comparison, we know much less about public opinion regarding cultural globalization. In addition, there has been little head-to-head testing of alternative explanations for public opinions in these areas. I contrast four arguments: skills, partisanship, economic evaluations, and beliefs about the free market, consumerism, and modern life, which I test using survey information taken from 17 developed and developing countries from 2002. I find that values are a powerful and understudied explanation for variations in public opinion. Regardless of whether the question dealt with economic or cultural globalization, views about the free market, consumerism, and modern life had more explanatory power than evaluations of the economy or partisanship, and roughly the same explanatory powers as skill levels. These findings provide important insights into the sources of the globalization backlash and have important implications for how globalization should be both studied and theorized.;

AB;This paper highlights the ethical implications of the distinction between micro- and macroeconomics, arguing that the methodological emphasis on establishing microfoundations has hardened into a liberal-individualist normative bias. We first argue that the key difference between micro- and macroeconomics is less any ostensible concern for small- or large-scale processes than a value-laden emphasis on the priority of private or public interests. We then show how these methodological assumptions have structured policy debates over the past century, from the emergence of Keynesian macroeconomics in the aftermath of the Great Depression to the more recent neoliberal emphasis on policy credibility. This analysis highlights the unappreciated ethical components of policy debates in the age of globalization, and the ways in which methodological biases infuse even the most ostensibly positive models with normative implications.;

TI;Theorising globalisation's social impact: proposing the concept of vulnerability;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"globalisation; vulnerability; social impact; poverty/inequality; human security; interdependence";
AB;The concept of vulnerability was introduced into IR theorising by Keohane and Nye who saw it as one of the consequences of complex interdependence and it is being increasingly employed by IGOs to capture the impact of globalisation on society. However, the concept has been little used in the academic literature on globalisation, except in a descriptive sense. This article argues that the concept has the potential to fill a gap in the toolkit of the 'new' IPE, offering an analytical category that can capture the distinctive impact of globalisation on society more adequately than other concepts that are more widely used. The article begins by surveying how the concept has been used by Keohane and Nye and by IGOs. It then offers a definition and illustrates the application of the concept by describing some of the principal ways in which globalisation is increasing risk and eroding coping mechanisms. It goes on to argue that the concept of vulnerability captures in a fuller way the distinctive social impact of globalisation than do other concepts widely used in the IPE literature, examining in turn the limitations of the concepts of poverty/inequality, risk and insecurity. Finally, the article situates the concept of vulnerability within the social theory of Karl Polanyi, arguing that it expresses in the conditions of today's globalisation the threats to human livelihood from the inroads of the market that are widely referred to by scholars within the 'new' IPE, capturing better than do other concepts the key features of these threats as seen by Polanyi. The article concludes by proposing the concept of vulnerability as a core conceptual category for IPE scholars that offers the potential for the disciplinary field to generate more original insights into the social impacts of the political economy processes to the understanding of which it has made such a major contribution.;

In this article I examine four protected areas in Africa and India were these interests have been pursued with various degrees of success. A critical application of the concept of global commodity chains helps to clarify how eco-tourism works, and what are its main driving forces. Friction between local practices and global conservation norms has been frequent. In the study, governance structures, local ownership and institutions for solving disputes and for joint management have been present in the more successful cases.;

TI;Restructuring the state in a globalizing world: capital accumulation, tangled hierarchies and the search for a new spatio-temporal fix;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Review;
DE;"space; globalization; Marxism; rescaling; capitalism";
AB;A main concern of debates on the changing role and form of the state and the relationship of these with the process of globalization has been the role of capitalism. Jessop, a well known exponent of Marxist political theory, tackles the broader range of issues but, like the urban sociologist Brenner, is most interesting when he writes about the institutional restructuring or 'rescaling' of the state along lines that go well beyond multi-level governance to unstable 'tangled hierarchies' and the still nebulous search for a 'new spatio-temporal fix' for social, political and economic organization. Both authors seek to give socio-political variables a higher degree of independence in explaining change and eschew economic determinism, although the central importance they give to 'accumulation strategies' and, in Jessop's case, to Marxist theories of value, make this assertion problematic from a non-Marxist perspective. Thus although the authors emphasize the significance of 'extra-economic' interactions between complex interests and actors, I argue that they also retain a sense that there is an underlying economic-structural imperative at work 'in the last analysis'.;

ID;"MONETARY-UNION; CONVERGENCE; GLOBALIZATION; COUNTRIES; LIBERALIZATION; ADJUSTMENT; DEMOCRACY; ECONOMY; RISKS; STATE";
AB;"Post-communist Europe's increasing convergence with the European Union has generated contentious debate over the underlying impetus for this change. Did the material incentives and implicit coercion inherent in the EU accession process prod East Central European leaders onwards in their reform efforts, or did they adopt new institutions because of the deeper effects of persuasion and socialization? This article uses central banking to make two arguments in relation to this debate. First, differently situated domestic actors may support EU-style institutional convergence in the same issue-area for different reasons; while external incentives may primarily motivate one group, another may fully accept and internalize the underlying EU norms. Such two-track diffusion is more likely to occur when an epistemic community drives the domestic socialization process, because under these conditions socialization can advance within a small group or single institution without requiring active encouragement from other domestic actors. Second, problematic consequences of two-track diffusion appear only after EU accession becomes assured, relaxing or removing external incentives for compliance. At that point, socialized actors may find that they no longer enjoy wider domestic support. I demonstrate this through an examination of Czech and Hungarian central bankers' efforts to adopt the Euro quickly despite the potential risks involved. The socialized central bankers took this position out of weakness, not strength, viewing the external constraint of Euro adoption as the only way to ensure conservative fiscal and monetary policies after EU accession.";

DT;Article;
DE;"World Bank; globalization; neoliberalism; development research; Knowledge Bank";
ID;"POVERTY; GLOBALIZATION; LIBERALISM; PROLOGUE";
AB;Despite widespread analysis of theWorld Bank's lending operations by both supporters and critics, there has been little external or systematic analysis of the Bank's research department. This is remarkable, given that the Bank has become the hub of development research worldwide. This article begins to fill in that gap by exploring the political economy of the research conducted within the World Bank's Development Economics Vice-Presidency (DEC). Despite the Bank's public presentation of its research arm as conducting 'rigorous and independent' work, the Bank's research has historically become skewed toward reinforcing the dominant neoliberal policy agenda. The article includes a detailed examination of the mechanisms by which the Bank's research department is able to play a central role in what Robert Wade has elsewhere termed 'paradigm maintenance', including incentives in hiring, promotion, and publishing, as well as selective enforcement of rules, discouragement of dissonant data, and actual manipulation of data. The author's analysis is based on in-depth interviews with current and former World Bank professionals, as well as examination of internal and external World Bank documents. The article includes analysis of the Bank's treatment of the work of two of its researchers who write on economic globalization and development: David Dollar and Branko Milanovic.;

ID;"REGIMES; EUROPE";
AB;This article regards the EMU as part of a broader strategy to revitalize the European economy by creating a strong European base within the transnational finance-led regime of accumulation. Examining the broader implications of this strategy, the article applies the Coxian conceptual triangle of state-civil society complexes, social relations of production and world order. As far as the reconfiguration of the European state-civil society complex is concerned, the article shows first that the European Union has built up quite remarkable, however, primarily introverted governance capacities in the fields of monetary and financial market policies. Secondly, with respect to the social relations of production, it points out that changes within the European financial environment tend to undermine the particular social conditions and relations which have underpinned innovation and productivity growth so far. Finally, in terms of world order, the article shows that the material and organisational capacities of the EU are still much too weak to challenge the dominant role of the US. Nevertheless, under conditions of global trade imbalances, economic stagnation, and the crises of social reproduction and political legitimacy it is likely that transatlantic cooperation will become more difficult.;

TI;Globalization and why the 'time is ripe' for the transformation of German industrial relations;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"economic globalization; threatened exit and competition; German industrial relations; working time politics; employers; transformation processes";
ID;"INSTITUTIONS; EROSION; UNIONS";
AB;Recent scholarship on globalization and industrial relations supports the full gamut of possibilities: that globalization constrains, strengthens, or has nothing to do with industrialized-country bargaining institutions and outcomes. But most empirical work focuses on direct connections between outcomes and trade and/or direct investment flows, thus discounting the role of threatened exit and competition, or of indirect links involving employers and employer organization and strategy. This paper studies the 2003 campaign for the East-West equalization of conditions in the German metal industry, and finds that globalization has affected the bargaining outcome much more than standard accounts suggest. First, the Eastern EU-enlargement-an element of globalization-created a 'now or never' atmosphere that helped to spark the union's initiative. Employers' vehement opposition was frequently clothed in concerns about labor costs, emphasizing losses in international competitiveness and/or jobs to low-wage countries. And employers exercised frequent exit threats that were instrumental in splitting workforces by inducing fears and in instilling an anti-union mood. Finally, the bargaining round inspired large firms to question the central bargaining institution, thereby subordinating social peace to the goal of defeating IG Metall. This and subsequent developments in West Germany point to a transformation of German industrial relations as a partial consequence of economic globalization.;

DT;Article;
DE;"IMF; representation; accountability; constituencies; governance; organization";
AB;The IMF is governed by a 24-member Executive Board which represents 184 countries. Although often prized as a small and efficient decision-making body, the Board represents some countries more effectively than others. This is due to the institutional structure and incentives within which the Board operates. Prime among them is a system of constituencies which have formed and evolved as countries have sought to improve their position in the organization. These groups vary in size, shared interests, and distribution of power. Their effectiveness is not only affected by these attributes. It is also determined by decision-making rules across the institution, by the lack of formal accountability of Board members, and by the strength of other coalitions of countries acting informally within the institution. The analysis implies that representation on the IMF Board could be improved without altering the size of the Board.;

AB;"As part of an overall focus on governance in international political economy, the corruption issue has catapulted from the margins of academic and policy discourse on international affairs to a position as one of the central problems facing transition economies and the developing world today. But the irreducibly normative character of anti-corruption discourse is in tension with the predominantly rationalist, technical and instrumental justifications for open markets which have long dominated the academic and institutional discourse on international political economy. A survey of the anti-corruption consensus reveals omissions and oversights which cause analysts to evade and obscure, rather than directly engage, core problems of politics and ethics; this may have practical consequences for anti-corruption efforts. Republican political thought, though not without its own risks and flaws, may balance and correct some of the omissions and oversights of liberal and rationalist discourse on corruption.";

DE;"core labour standards; labour rights; freedom of association; International Labour Organization; World Bank; International Monetary Fund";
AB;Integrating core labour standards (CLS) into the operations of the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO has become a primary goal of the international labour movement. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the ILO have persuaded the IMF and the Bank to accept CLS, including freedom of association and collective bargaining. Since they can impose painful sanctions on violators, incorporating labour rights enforcement into the international organizations that regulate the international economy has great appeal for the labour movement. I argue that there are potential dangers in this effort. The ILO's understanding of freedom of association is distinctly liberal and promotes the formation of 'free' as opposed to powerful trade unions. In this liberal conceptualization, many labour regulations that enhance labour's power by limiting union fragmentation and increasing bargaining power are considered to be violations of freedom of association. In practice this has meant that the ILO makes policy recommendations that encourage union competition and that discourage centralized collective bargaining. Although framed in different language, these policies mesh well with the agenda of the BrettonWoods institutions. An analysis of Indonesia and Argentina shows how the ILO's understanding of freedom of association has mixed consequences for the strength of the labour movement.;

TI;'Flowers and criticism': The political economy of the renminbi debate;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"exchange rates; renminbi; China; international adjustment";
AB;Since 2003 China has faced increasing pressure, especially from the US and Japan, to revalue the renminbi. In July 2005 China responded by announcing a small revaluation and a switch from a dollar peg to a tightly managed float against a currency basket. The mainstream economic debate, which we briefly review, has focused on whether, and to what extent, the renminbi is undervalued. From a political economy perspective, however, the more interesting question is why China has been so reluctant to significantly revalue the renminbi especially since it was keen to prove itself a 'responsible member of the international community' by not devaluing in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. We argue that this can be explained by three factors. These are, firstly, the diminished ability of China's policy-makers to use the export tax rebate policy to mitigate the effects of a revaluation. Secondly, there are differences in the regional context between the two time periods. Thirdly, in the international game of 'problem assignment', China refuses to accept that the US trade deficit is its 'problem'.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"health policy; market socialism; services; Vietnam; development; equality; growth; state";
AB;This paper analyzes Vietnam's health policies. It adopts an interpretative framework stressing that policy approaches to strategic and commercial services, on one hand, and social services, on the other hand, should be fundamentally different, given the structurally different nature of such diverse services activities. The paper analyzes the evolution of health policies during the doi moi period and reviews the national and international debate on health systems reforms, arguing that an approach prone to blur the intrinsic difference between social and non-social services has led to market-oriented health reforms that are severely flawed in Vietnam, with negative impacts on universality of access, equity, poverty, and efficiency. In sum, social services policies, and policies in the domain of health in particular, appear to constitute the weakest and most contentious component of Vietnam's otherwise extremely successful development strategy. Therefore, they are a prime candidate for critical re-examination.;

DE;"informal sector; structural adjustment; sectoral and social disarticulation; Latin America";
ID;"LATIN-AMERICA; GROWTH";
AB;"The rise of informal labour activities in Latin America in the era of neoliberal reform has necessitated a revision of earlier accounts which argued that low-paying informal work resulted primarily from excessive government regulation of product and factor markets. Under market-oriented adjustment and stabilization policies that promoted trade and capital market reform; altered the relative prices of capital and labour; and fostered greater degrees of labour market 'flexibility', the informal sector grew. In response, the revisionist argument transformed informal activity from an indication of systemic vice to that of systemic virtue. In the presence of growing structural unemployment, rising income inequality, and stagnant or falling real wages for many, the argument that proceeded from virtue is found wanting and marked by mis-specification and contradiction. Instead, and given the discrepancy between the progress of labour productivity and the weakening of real wages in both the formal and informal sectors, a case is made that the emerging system is both sectorally and socially disarticulated along the lines enunciated years earlier by Alain de Janvry and others.";

ID;"GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; COMMODITY CHAIN; GLOBALIZATION; CAPITALISM; TRADE; DISINTEGRATION; HIERARCHY; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; PRICES";
AB;This paper employs a global value chains (GVC) perspective to recent developments in the coffee market, associated with the behavior of market structure in a context of widening spreads around declining prices and affirms that due to their imperfect inclusion in the global economy, primary markets have entered 'terminal crisis'. The paper asserts that while the role of state-territorial regimes of governance has noticeably weakened in the current ('terminal crisis') context, the combined strategic positioning of ('related') players, residing at highly imperfect, monopolized nodes has become the key shaper of development and this has had a de-stabilizing effect on the poorest. The paper observes that systemic crisis appears to be resolvable, subject to the ability of emerging new redistributive outcomes to reposition the coffee system at a qualitatively new equilibrium. In contributing to a more systematic (value-chain centered) line of enquiry on the relationship between development and inequality, the paper analytically expands key relationships in the GVC framework (using extra inputs from strategic management, economic trade and convention theory) and offers to policymaking a framework for 'combating' falling terms of trade in primary markets by means of new economic relations.;

ID;"INTERNATIONAL-ORGANIZATIONS; EMBEDDED LIBERALISM; POLITICS; CRISIS; MARKET; WORLD";
AB;Why were capital controls orthodox in 1944, but heretical in 1997? The scholarly literature, following the conventional wisdom, focuses on the role of the United States in promoting capital liberalization. Although the United States encouraged capital liberalization bilaterally, US policy makers never embraced multilateral rules that codified the norm of capital mobility. Rather, European policy makers wrote the most important rules in favour of the free movement of capital. Paradoxically, French policy makers in particular played decisive roles. For the debates that mattered most-in the EU, OECD, and IMF-the United States was, respectively, irrelevant, inconsequential and indifferent. Europe did not capitulate to global capital. Rather, French and other European policy makers created today's liberal international financial regime. French and European policy makers have promoted a rule-based, 'managed' globalization of finance, whereas US policy makers have tended to embrace an ad hoc globalization based on the accumulation of bilateral bargains. Once liberal rules were codified in the EU and OECD, they constituted the policy practices of 'European' and 'developed' states, for which capital controls are no longer considered a legitimate policy tool. During the middle of the 1990s, the IMF debated new, universal rules in favour of capital freedom, but the proposal was defeated, primarily by the US Congress, after the financial crises of 1997-98. By then the vast majority of the world's capital flows were already governed by the liberal rules of the EU and OECD.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Hungary; transition; mutual aid; civil society; local currencies";
ID;"EXCHANGE TRADING SCHEMES; RUSSIA";
AB;This paper examines the construction of green money, a civil society-based initiative in Hungary as a case study of the 'institutional' approach to the transition from command to market economies in East/Central Europe, which argues for the development of civil society organizations to facilitate structural changes in the economy. The paper compares programmes developed endogenously in Hungary through the diffusion of ideas about sustainability and economic democracy through international activist networks with those developed by a Hungarian NGO with support from western aid agencies. For the former, green money was a radical project aimed at developing alternative forms of livelihood through localized money networks, while for the latter it was a tool for ameliorating transition through the construction of mutual aid and community feeling. The paper points to problems in building new civil society institutions, arguing that while some of the difficulties encountered were technical problems that reflect the poor performance of green money as a development tool, other problems reflect more structural, political and cultural problems. The paper argues that over-optimistic conceptualizations of the potential of civil society in the facilitation of inclusive transition need to be more cognisant of the difficulties in constructing civil society from the outside.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"Brazil; bond markets; elections; emerging markets; government autonomy";
AB;This study uses an investment bank's fixed income research reports to analyse in unusual detail the investment activities and attitudes of international emerging bond market investors during the extreme market volatility over the Brazilian presidential elections of 2002. In examining these investors' reaction to the prospect and subsequent policies of the left-wing Lula government, the article considers Mosley's (2003, Global Capital and National Governments, Cambridge, New York, Melbourne: Cambridge University Press) conclusions regarding the strength and breadth of the bond market's influence on emerging market governments. The data show that international bond market investors did not exit Brazil before the elections, putting in question whether they were the source of the rise in the cost of government borrowing that Mosley and others see as indicative of the market's strength. This suggests that our understanding of the actors responsible for market movements remains incomplete. The article, therefore, challenges the idea, common within international political economy, of 'the market' as a single entity, with common actions and policy preferences. The data presented strongly suggest 'the market' is in reality made up of multiple, heterogeneous actors, often lacking any unity of opinion or purpose. After Lula's election victory, market prices recovered and the data show that international investors increased their investments in Brazil, despite slower policy implementation than market practitioners desired and the new government's social agenda. This supports a questioning of the true breadth of investors' policy interests and, therefore, influence.;

DE;"monetary policy; gold standard; England; regime; central bank; banking";
ID;"CENTRAL BANK; ENGLAND; FRANCE";
AB;This article explores the ways in which the classical gold standard established the foundations for a modern international monetary system with its distinctive forms of crisis and regulatory frameworks. The specific nature of this transformation is often overlooked because of a tendency in the literature to compare the gold standard in relation to subsequent monetary systems, such as Bretton Woods. To remedy this historical bias, the classical gold standard is compared with previous monetary systems and it is concluded that it contributed to expand the array of monetary instruments for conducting monetary policy. By progressively subjecting the management of fiduciary money to state control the institutions of the gold standard created a new monetary framework that opened the way for central banking. However, the commitments taken to this effect, such as provisions on the convertibility of banknotes, created new opportunities for speculation. I argue that this new weakness would become the main preoccupation of monetary policy in the 20th century and lay down the foundations for international cooperation and its novel emphasis on monetary stability.;

AB;Globalization is closely associated with the turn towards neo-liberal economic strategies. One defining feature of neo-liberalism is labour market liberalization. The experiences of labour market reform in the Northeast Asian Newly Industrializing Countries of South Korea ( hereafter Korea) and Taiwan exhibit differences from both the neo-liberal and alternative capitalist patterns commonly identified in the political economy literature. Using a comparative framework based on the criteria of labour market reform, political configurations, corporatist institutions, and the feedback effects of labour market policies, this article will reveal and explain the distinctiveness of the Northeast Asian pattern. Variations between Korea and Taiwan will also be explained using this framework. The findings here will contribute to the debate about how local institutions and politics interact with globalizing forces to produce divergent outcomes.;

DE;"transformation in Poland; enabling myths; foreign investment; aid; instituting";
ID;"TRANSNATIONAL CAPITALIST CLASS; EASTERN-EUROPE; MARKET";
AB;"This article examines the way in which foreign investment in the transforming economies of Central and Eastern Europe has been deeply concerned with shifting informal collective and individual understandings about economic behaviour in the workplace. The framework of the analysis is institutionalist, drawing on the idea that markets are socially embedded and politically instituted. Informal institutions are central to the analysis; in particular, their content, creation and recreation and contestation. Further, it is argued that enabling myths have been used to to displace the legacies associated with Communist workplaces to promulgate a set of ideas and institutions considered to be in line with competitive markets. Intense competition means that firms cannot wait for these ideas to change in an evolutionary way and therefore agents are actively engaged in transferring these myths across national boundaries through circuits of intellectual capital. The main agents for the diffusion of a new set of values associated with the market economy at the level of the workplace have been foreign investors. The entry and restructuring of two flagship investments are used to illustrate how firms have transferred corporate values across national boundaries to displace what were regarded as unsuitable mindsets associated with the previous regime.";

DT;Article;
DE;"globalization theory; global governance; industrial governance; state activism; foreign economic policy; WTO";
AB;Global and national governance are sometimes seen to stand in a zero-sum relationship, particularly in the post-GATT era of multilateral trade. A more nuanced view expects states to seek the benefits of multilateralism whilst finding convenient loopholes and escape routes from its policy constraints. This paper steers a different course, focusing on the overt ('legitimate') measures industrialized states are undertaking to succeed in the international arena. Rich nations as a group have carved out a multilateral order which best suits their current developmental trajectory - one that diminishes space for promoting industries critical to their climb up the development ladder, while increasing scope for sponsoring the technology-intensive sectors now critical to securing national prosperity. State activism continues and in some respects has taken on a more strategic and collaborative quality. This paper discusses several forms of 'strategic activism' in trade, technology, and finance and considers why it has emerged in the context of increased multilateral discipline.;

TI;Exchanging development for market access? Deep integration and industrial policy under multilateral and regional-bilateral trade agreements;

AB;This paper analyzes the developmental trade-offs involved in multilateral versus regional-bilateral strategies of integration into the international economy. I contrast the regulations that guide policy in the areas of trade, investment, and intellectual property in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in regional-bilateral agreements between the US and developing countries. Both strategies of integration feature similar trade-offs, in that developing countries gain increased market access and opportunities for specialization in exchange for diminished space for use of industrial policy instruments to create new productive capacities. However, the trade-offs are intensified in the case of regional-bilateral agreements: countries receive more market access, but in exchange make significantly deeper concessions regarding the management of inward investment and intellectual policy. I argue that countries whose integration into the international economy is guided by their obligations as members of the WTO still have opportunities to implement industrial strategies that are designed to alter comparative advantages and achieve upward mobility in the international economic order, but the obligations under the regional-bilateral strategy greatly circumscribe these options. The paper thus points to the need for new terms of reference in the debate over 'policy space' in the international political economy. In analyzing contemporary development strategies, the most useful contrast is not between the alternatives that countries have under the WTO and the alternatives that countries had in the past under the WTO's predecessors, but between a constraining multilateral environment and even more constraining regional and bilateral environments that condition increased market access on the sacrifice of the very tools that countries have historically used to capture the developmental benefits of integration into the international economy.;

AB;Defenders of the WTO argue that it provides an independent arena for hearing and adjudicating trade disputes. Member countries are bound by the decisions of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (WTO-DSB), and the perception of neutrality - that cases are ruled according to the strict and true meaning and spirit of the agreements that countries signed - is pivotal to its broader legitimacy. Using a fine-grained assessment of one trade dispute brought to the WTO, involving a complaint by Australia and New Zealand that US lamb tariffs contravened the WTO's safeguard provisions, this article questions these assumptions. It argues that the praxis of dispute settlement is over-determined by the institutionalized market preferences of the Organization. The procedural materiality of dispute settlement hinges on the narrow legalisms of wording within trade agreements, heard within an environment that is sympathetic to market liberal interpretations. With regard to safeguard provisions, and as evidenced in the case US - Lamb Meat, these institutional contexts create daunting obstacles for defendant countries to demonstrate they have not contravened WTO rules. These insights bring into relief debates on WTO dispute settlement as a system of global governance, providing support for the contention that this system should be understood as a political mechanism working systematically to advance trade liberalization.;

ID;"ASIA-PACIFIC; REGIONALISM; APEC; ARRANGEMENTS; DETERMINANTS; INTERESTS";
AB;Why do major economic powers seek more and more free trade agreements (FTAs) with smaller partners? Recently, Japan has joined the bandwagon by signing its first bilateral FTA. The decision, highly contested domestically, represents a sea change in Japanese trade policy and a challenging case for theories of regionalism. This paper lays out a theoretical appraisal for why more and more industrialized countries join FTAs with emerging markets and illustrates the argument with an analysis of the Japanese case. The paper argues that foreign direct investment (FDI) changes the incentives for states in favour of preferential trade agreements. Increased FDI and shifts in multinational firm strategies increase flows of intermediate goods. As a result, firms lobby their home governments to bolster their competitive position by signing preferential agreements. Yet, FTAs also discriminate against firms from third parties, motivating them to lobby for defensive agreements. The qualitative case studies show how NAFTA discriminates against Japanese FDI in Mexico. As a result, firms began to lobby the Japanese trade bureaucracy, changing the perception of key policymakers who developed a strategy of pursuing preferential trade agreements in the Asia Pacific region, as shown in a case study of the initiative for an FTA with Thailand.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"globalization; global redistribution; soccer; labour";
AB;Soccer ( football in the non-American terminology) is the most globalized sport. Free circulation of players has markedly increased during the last ten to fifteen years as limits on the number of foreign players in the European leagues have been lifted, and clubs have become more commercially minded. On the other hand, the rules governing national team competition have remained restrictive: players can play only for the country where they were born. We show that, in a model where there is free circulation of labour, increasing returns to scale, and endogeneity of skills, this produces on the one hand, higher overall quality of the game and increasing inequality of results among clubs, and on the other hand, lower inequality in the national teams' performances. The empirical examples from the history of the European Champions' League and the World Cup support the implications of the model. We argue in the conclusions, that soccer's global rules allow poor countries to capture some of their 'leg drain', that is the improved skills which their players have acquired playing for better foreign clubs. This provides an example as how forces of efficiency but also inequality unleashed by globalization can be harnessed by the existence of global institutions to help improve the outcome for the poor countries.;

SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"NGOs; emergency relief; internationalization; globalization; ECHO; French doctors";
ID;WORLD;
AB;This article studies the internationalization of four French NGOs (Medecins du Monde, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Action Contre la Faim and Handicap International). This study relativizes the somewhat idealistic hypothesis of the flourishing of a global civil society. Indeed, the reasons for NGOs to develop foreign sections are not only based on value diffusion. The growing competition between NGOs encourages them to turn 'global' in order to adapt themselves in order to expand their ability to obtain human and financial resources, both public and private, which seems analogous to the effect that the processes of internationalization has on transnational firms. However, the analogy between NGOs and transnational firms should be carefully handled. While this analogy is surely heuristic in that it focuses attention on an often-neglected aspect of NGOs' internationalization, this analogy nevertheless has limits. States continue to maintain a strong influence on these NGOs' identities and the reasons for their internationalization. Furthermore, analyzing the internationalization of these NGOs is a way of specifying what is meant by 'globalization' as an environment constraining organizational strategies. Economic globalization certainly has an indirect role on NGOs' internationalization by the worldwide development of inequalities at the global level and the tendency for states and international organizations to subcontract social policies to the Third Sector. Yet there is a parallel, rather than a causal, relationship between the internationalization of NGOs and the growth of transnational firms. Therefore, other aspects of globalization are needed to understand the development of NGOs: these aspects include not only the growth and extension of means of communication, but also the increasingly intense competition for the comparative advantages resulting from state fragmentation.;

DE;"altermondialisme; anti-capitalism";
AB;That 'AnotherWorld is Possible' has become the ensign of the left's common sense. For lack of having been thought through, and for want to take it all in, the new reasonableness has given itself a hollow name with a ring to it: altermondialisme. Notwithstanding fashionable certainties, everything about it needs to be problematized, both because, in carrying on the century-old internationalist drive for programmatic coherence, altermondialisme rather stands at the rearguard of the movement than at its forefront, and because in its relationship to it, it reproduces rather than challenges attempts by the World Bank et al. to contain contemporary anti-capitalism and empty it of political possibilities. The text is divided into three parts. In the first, I identify what I take to be an essential political dynamic of contemporary world order: the attempt by regulatory agencies of global capitalism to invent a functional, civil and perfectly apolitical global subject that could serve as an ideal social companion to global-neo-liberalism. In the second part of the text, I work from concepts that originated with the Internationale Situationniste to begin making political sense of contemporary anti-capitalist praxis. In the third part of the article, I extract from the first two principles of articulation that may allow us to understand contemporary anti-capitalism for what it is, without containing or reifying it.;

Black boxes are devices, practices, or organizations that are opaque to outsiders, often because their contents are regarded as 'technical'. The goal of opening black boxes is to discover how they are kept opaque; how they structure their 'contexts'; and how those contexts are inscribed within them. Four types of black box in finance are discussed: option pricing theory; arbitrage; 'ethnoaccountancy'; and regulation. The limitations of the opening of black boxes as an oppositional strategy are also discussed.";

DE;"operational risk; basel committee; banking regulation; enforced self-regulation; internal control; RAROC";
ID;"HISTORY; STATE";
AB;Until the 'Basel 2' reforms to banking supervision, operational risk was largely a residual category for risks and uncertainties which were difficult to quantify, insure and manage in traditional ways. This paper examines the rapid emergence of operational risk from this low epistemic status to its institutionalization as a key component of global banking regulation. However, the meaning and implications of the Basel proposals have been fiercely contested by international banks and three key domains of policy controversy have been, and remain, particularly visible: definitional issues, data collection and the limits of quantification. Tensions in these three areas are discussed and reveal the significance of operational risk as a meeting point for diverse concerns and interests, and as a potential reinvention of a management knowledge hybrid between auditing and finance. The paper draws attention to the ironies and contradictions of this operational risk programme, which is part of a visionary project to extend 'enforced self-regulation' deep into the operations of banking, combining advanced technical modelling ideas on the one hand and softer corporate governance thinking on the other. The Basel 2 proposals demonstrate the policy effectiveness of 'operational risk' as an agenda-forming category for diverse communities of interest, and reinforces the relevance of a political economy of regulation which emphasizes knowledge production by multiple and competing organizational agents.;

DE;"investment; arbitration; private authority; transnational governance";
ID;"GLOBALIZATION; SEATTLE";
AB;Conventionally, investors could not sue states directly under international law and arbitration tribunals did not have general jurisdiction over international investment disputes. This has changed, especially since the early 1990s, with the emergence of an international system of investor protection that combines investor-state arbitration and broad standards of investor protection. The system elevates the legal status of investors (but not other individuals) in international law by allowing them to make international claims for damages against host states. Although the system depends on state authority for its establishment and ongoing effectiveness, the system adopts private authority as a method of transnational governance by permitting private investors to make claims and by giving private arbitrators the power to resolve those claims. This provides significant advantages to multinational enterprises at the expense of governmental flexibility in both capital-importing and capital-exporting states, as revealed by the recent explosion of investor claims. This article examines the legal architecture of the system in order to demonstrate how it expands private authority in the context of transnational governance.;

TI;Hegemons of a lesser God: the Bank of France and monetary leadership under the classical gold standard;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"gold standard; banking international finance; hegemony; monetary history";
ID;"STABILITY THEORY; PUBLIC-GOODS; ECONOMY";
AB;Conventional theories of international hegemony all agree on the fact that the stabilizing functions of hegemons (i.e. nations that use their power to maintain orderly relations in a given issue-area) are positively correlated with their power. The public goods logic upon which this vision is founded posits that as any potential leader becomes more powerful in a given issue area, it will increasingly see its own welfare as synonymous with order in the entire constellation of relations within the issue area itself, and consequently have an incentive to provide the necessary public goods (i.e. the components of stability) to bring such order about. Monetary relations under the classical gold standard (1880-1914), however, demonstrated an entirely different set of circumstances. The principal financial actor of the period (the Bank of England) showed little interest in stabilizing monetary relations during that period. It was in fact the Bank of France, a secondary monetary power, which acted much more robustly as monetary leader under the gold standard in protecting convertibility in gold-club nations. But rather than emanating from a perception of strength, such leadership functions in fact emanated from a sense of financial vulnerability. Hence, monetary leadership under the gold standard significantly tilts conventional hegemonic stability theory in that it reveals relative weakness as a catalyst for stabilizing behavior. Moreover, the stabilization functions of the Bank of France were marshaled for the purpose of keeping France in a secondary financial position to Britain, as a front line status would have placed France in the forefront as an international financial shock absorber, which the Bank sought to avoid for the sake of stability in French finance. In revealing a tendency to relent from enhancing a relative position in financial status, this case also cuts against common tenets of hegemonic stability theory. This article suggests that secondary powers can effectively serve the leadership functions traditionally ascribed to hegemons. Such functions can be carried out both directly (as stabilizers) and indirectly (as facilitators of cooperation).;

DE;"policy transfer; world bank; privatization; electricity reform";
ID;"REGULATORY REFORM; POWER; SECTOR; STATE; CHINA";
AB;This paper argues that the standard model for reforming and restructuring the electricity industry advocated by the World Bank does not work, especially in developing and transition economies. The argument is based on the observation that there is one 'standard' model that is formulated by economists, elaborated from the reform experience in England and Wales, developed into a template for reform by the World Bank, and then transplanted to developing and transition economies. This template for reform has suffered from many failures and no successes, but is still retained. The question is how the World Bank could have got it so wrong in selling the template worldwide. The first section shows the disconnection between the institutionalized economic research and the reality. The second section discusses how the economic model was translated into policy prescriptions by the World Bank, the major force for pushing the reform. The third section examines briefly the reform experience in Orissa, India and China to show that, first, the template does not work because of original disconnection between the economic ideals and political reality, and, second, even if some ideas of the template might have merits, the template could not be copied as it stands.;

AB;Tourism is increasingly recognised and studied for its economic, political and social importance. This article examines the political economy of tourist imaging in South Africa, and its effect on tourism impact in the country. It investigates the nature of the international tourism production system that South Africa is part of, and the role of producers, particularly tour operators and marketers, in the creation and dissemination of distinct images. It is shown that the image that is predominantly sold by such producers in international markets-focused on the natural, rather than the cultural components of the South African tourist product-is a continuation of the image established during the apartheid era. This has a developmental impact, moreover, as tourist imaging affects tourist flows. This negates the attempts of the South African government to develop and promote a more encompassing image, one that is dually aimed at meeting some of the domestic, political and economic objectives of the government, and shore up some of the government's foreign policy endeavours. Overall, analysing the political economy of a sector such as tourism can provide useful insights into some of the strategies used by developing countries to participate in global systems of production and consumption, and factors that influence their success.;

AB;Turkey initiated an extensive dis-inflation program in December 1999 backed and supervised by The International Monetary Fund ( IMF). The program aimed at decreasing the inflation rate to a single digit by the end of 2002. It exclusively relied on a nominally pegged ( anchored) exchange rate system for dis-inflation and on fiscal prudence. In February 2001, however, Turkey experienced a very severe financial crisis, which deepened and continued to-date. The official stance is that the crisis was the result of the failure of the public sector to maintain the austerity targets and the failure to implement fully the free market rationale of globalization. We argue in this article that, contrary to the official wisdom, the current economic and political crisis is not the result of a set of technical errors or administrative mismanagement unique to Turkey, but is the result of a series of pressures emanating from the process of integration with the global capital markets. We further provide a discussion on the fundamental parameters of the Turkish politics connected with the crisis.;

TI;Economic reform after the financial crisis: a critical assessment of institutional transition and transition costs in South Korea;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"financial crisis; economic reform; institution; transition; Korea; globalization";
AB;This paper assesses the structural reform after the financial crisis in Korea by investigating its benefits and costs to the economy. It argues that Korea's rapid economic recovery in 1999-2000 was a Keynesian recovery, not a reform-led one. It also argues that, despite the fact that there has been a significant advancement in formal changes in institutions, economic costs arising from attempting a radical institutional transition have been unduly large. We attribute this disappointing performance mainly to the fact that the radical reform has created a vacuum in the risk-taking function in the economy and therefore resulted in a continued credit crunch in the corporate sector. The Korean case suggests the importance of diversity and incrementalism in designing institutional transition, rather than attempting to implement `global standard' policies and institutions.;

TI;GATS in context: development, an evolving lex mercatoria and the Doha Agenda;

ID;"THIRD-WORLD; TRADE; GLOBALIZATION; WTO; TERRITORIALITY; LEGITIMACY; POVERTY; ECONOMY; PROJECT; BOLIVIA";
AB;As the hub of the organization for world trade, the WTO has been subject to critical scrutiny from various political and theoretical persuasions. Beyond merely the exchange of goods across borders, the complex and expansive WTO framework is one that encompasses juridical and political capacity to oversee and facilitate the regulation of `property rights' on a global scale. Therefore, it is not surprising that the social and political organization of world trade law is increasingly subject to controversies over its nature and implications for world politics. One field where these play out prominently is the one marked by competing social and political visions of development, with advocates of the world trade agenda considering development to be premised upon the consolidation and entrenchment of lex mercatoria ( or commercial law). The key institution to oversee global development, in this view, is the WTO. However, important evaluations of the trajectories of development are taking place outside the framework of this particular and recent trade-development discourse. Through a critical appraisal of this mainstream trade-development discourse we draw attention to its a historical nature and ask, what is the relationship of the normative and substantive underpinnings of the WTO Doha `Development' agenda with world historical development? We advance two politically significant points. The first pertains to the relationship between trade, the political economy of development, and poverty. The second, and related point is essentially a methodological comment on the framing of development. The state-centric groundings of the trade and development agenda, as well as its rationalist assumptions, obscure substantive analysis of the social and political implications of global development in relational terms. If viewed from the perspective of social experience, the Doha Development Round fails as a `development' agenda. Against this backdrop, we draw on the example of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) - a key component of the Doha Round - and suggest that the theory of poverty that underpins orthodox development theory serves to legitimize, stabilize and advance a particular politically steered world order: this theory is constituted through an abstraction from social realities, and thus seeks to stabilise and `naturalize' social power relations conducive to `development through inequality'.;

TI;The 'nature' of environmental services: GATS, the environment and the struggle over the global institutionalization of private law;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"global political economy; political ecology; trade in environmental services; GATS; critical theory; modernity";
ID;PARADOX;
AB;The article traces the contradictions in the current phase of the formation of Global Trade Governance via an inquiry into the discourse surrounding environmental services. The analysis elucidates the inadvertent politicization of environmental services, which paradoxically emerges within a context of attempts to insulate and depoliticize the Trade in Services agenda more generally. It provides an interpretation of this dynamic from a political ecology perspective. As a site of profound definitional problems, the Trade in Environmental Services discourse reveals deep-seated contradictions lodged in social relations with nature. The contradictions are explored via a critical deconstruction of the very concept of `environmental services', which aids the identification of sites of political engagement vis-a-vis the substantiation of `global modernity' through economic integration. The developmental logic of capitalist modernity expands into areas where its contradictory nature becomes, once more, tangible, the subject of a social experience of detrimental forms of relations wit nature, and thus subject to political struggle. The article concludes by illustrating the argument with examples from the Environmental Services Trade agenda.;

TI;GATS: long-term strategy for the commodification of education;
SO;REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY;
LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"education; GATS; European Union; commodification; liberalization; transnational education";
AB;The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) covers also the cross-border provision of education. Currently negotiations are underway to expand the scope of the liberalization commitments in GATS. The article describes the strategies that allowed education to be seen as a tradable commodity. It analyzes the specific role of GATS procedures and of the already existent GATS commitments in the process of the commodification of education. It assesses the competitive lead of Anglo-Saxon providers. It looks at what is at stake in the current round taking the case of the EU as an example. The EU stands for countries that have not yet made many commitments and are now under pressure to liberalize education. The article argues that the concerns about the future impact of GATS are to be taken seriously. In line with the spread of neo-liberal constitutionalism, GATS provides a political and legal framework for deregulation and privatization of education. GATS can be used to secure the power of capital in the long term by privileging private owners of educational services in relation to the public and to the actual providers of these services, the faculty.;

LA;English;
DT;Article;
DE;"World Trade Organisation ( WTO); General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS); international trade; health services; health systems; regulation";
ID;"WORLD-TRADE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MIGRATION; MARKETS";
AB;"The literature on the GATS and trade in health services is limited, largely speculative, and polarised between `trade' and `health systems' perspectives. The distinctive features of the market for health services, particularly in developing countries, means that the `benefits of trade' argument is not applicable: the potential economic benefits of trade in health services are limited, while its potential effects on health systems, particularly through the supply of health professionals to public services, are substantially negative in almost all developing countries. GATS commitments have not encouraged trade, and there is little reason to anticipate this, except possibly in Mode 3; but they seriously constrain health policy. The effectiveness of GATS safeguard provisions is at best doubtful; and the stronger domestic regulation needed in open health service markets is beyond the capacity of most developing countries. Proposed GATS-consistent regulations to offset adverse effects of trade in health services are untested, unrealistic, impracticable, ineffectual, and/or have serious limitations or adverse side-effects. GATS commitments are binding, backed by sanctions, and of indefinite duration; but key provisions are ambiguous, and the future extent, nature and effects of trade in health services very uncertain. Analysis and data are very limited and analytical frameworks undeveloped. There is thus no basis for informed decision-making on GATS commitments; and decision-making processes mean that health considerations play a very limited role. Therefore, the GATS framework is inappropriate as a basis for international rules on trade in health services; and it is undesirable for developing countries to make GATS commitments in the health sector.";

AB;"Leaders of commodity-exporting states will sometimes push exports even when world prices are declining, if export receipts allow access to international capital markets. This article demonstrates that such state-mediated ties between commodity and capital markets shaped the politics of foreign trade in tsarist, and then Soviet, Russia. It also refutes an alternate, group-centered explanation of the same historical cases proposed in Rogowski's Commerce and Coalitions, pointing out serious empirical errors and oversights. These empirical problems have methodological roots. Searching for universal ""laws,"" rather than sometimes relevant "" mechanisms,"" limits the consideration of counterhypotheses to those that apply to a whole universe of cases, rather than a subset of them. Because such counterhypotheses serve to determine which data are relevant, their exclusion weakens the empirical tests to which proposed laws are subjected. Thus, the ambition for generality may cause scholars to become inadvertently too generous to the theories they seek to test.";

ID;"LIFE-SCIENCE; INDUSTRY; GERMANY; UNIVERSITY; FACULTY; PROJECT";
AB;The assumption that technological innovation constitutes an inevitable facet of something called 'globalisation' is called into question by comparative historical investigation. In the areas of biotechnology and genome research, for instance, the United States and Germany - two advanced industrial states have demonstrated remarkably different historical trajectories. While the US was a driving force behind the explosion of biotechnology as an industrial sector, Germany was unable to muster much effort until the late 1990s. Explaining this difference, this article utilizes historical political economy to characterize these states and their relationship to capitalism. The lag in German efforts is understood as a function of the pre-capitalist vestiges of the state and their peculiar effects on capitalist social relations.;

AB;Since the 1980s, the international market for commercial surrogacy has grown at a quiet but considerable pace. Each year, thousands of women agree to carry, for a fee, the child of another woman. Thousands of babies are born as a result on shaky legal legs: conceived by one set of parents yet claimed by another. Most of these children were born in the market as well as the womb, the product of desire combined with the ability to pay. The central argument of this paper is that surrogacy must be approached as a commercial relationship. There is already an active international trade in the components of baby production - wombs, sperm and eggs. There are rapidly advancing technologies that are certain to expand both the demand for surrogacy services and the supply of surrogate mothers. Yet the underpinnings of the surrogacy market - the rules, laws, rights and contracts - have been notably slower to evolve. Legislative bodies in both the United States and Europe have been loath to deal directly with the issue of surrogacy, intervening primarily in the form of prohibition. Yet because the demand function in this market can be so intense, couples are entering into surrogacy arrangements even when they suspect that the underlying contract is either illegal or unenforceable. Fundamentally, commercial surrogacy is an issue of political economy. It involves an economic relationship that sits within a deeply political calculus, one that goes to the very heart of political economy. What, the debate over surrogacy asks, can legitimately be sold in a market transaction? Who decides? And how can any authority weigh the desires of having a child against the dangers of selling one?;

AB;"The scholarly debate over the causes of currency crises has reached an impasse with policy failure and market power approaches engaged in a deadlocked ""tug-of-war."" In an effort to break this deadlock, this article builds and applies a social theory of currency crises drawing on work in political theory and the sociology of embedded business networks. It argues that changes in trust relations between state and market actors influence exchange relations by mediating how these actors assess risks. This approach differs from existing accounts in two fundamental ways. First, it takes an international political economy view to what has traditionally been seen as a domestic political economy issue. Second, it argues that currency relations are mediated by socially-constituted relations of trust, relations generally deemed epiphenomenal in mainstream theory. This ""authority network"" approach is then applied to the interwar gold standard crisis. The case study illustrates how variations in trust relations among networked actors produce distinct logics of economic exchange, influence state and market actor behavior and thereby produce episodes of currency stability, volatility and crisis that rationalist approaches struggle to explain.";

AB;Although it is often conceived as a key aspect of neo-liberal globalization, appeals to 'mass investment' have actually occupied much longer and more complex historical contexts than are often acknowledged. This paper draws upon archival material of the advertising, educational and 'cultural' campaigns developed by the New York Stock Exchange in the immediate postwar period in an attempt to recover one fragment of these earlier lines of force occupied by mass investment. In doing so, this paper pursues a 'cultural economy' of the NYSE programs to accomplish two objectives: 1) to foreground finance as something that is culturally constituted, and 2) to underscore 'capital' not as a macro-structural entity but as something made possible in the spaces of everyday life and through the processes in which individuals govern themselves in those spaces. Cultural-economic analysis, this paper concludes, can help complicate critical conceptions of 'finance' by moving away from epochal analysis and by developing more historically-situated accounts of the financial world and the 'everyday' contexts it has occupied.;
